            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> in the yeare 1552. upon the fourteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being knowne by the name of <hi>Pietro,</hi> but, being of a very thinne body, was by a nickname of the Citty called <hi>Piernio,</hi> or little <hi>Peter.</hi> His father was <hi>Franceſco di Pietro Sarpi</hi> originally by his anceſtors of <hi>Saint Vido,</hi> and of the province of <hi>Fruili.</hi> In <hi>Venice</hi> he exerciſed Merchandice, though with no great proſperitie. He traffiqued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into <hi>Soria,</hi> but with no better fortune; He was a fierce man, addicted more to warre then Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe; wherein he had ſucceſſes that brought him to a low condition: His mother was a <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> of an honeſt City-family, called <hi>Iſabella Morelli,</hi> who died in the contagion of the yeare 1576. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have heard it of her from ſome of the old
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98082:7"/>fathers of Monaſtry, that <hi>de ſervi;</hi> and from an old coſen of hers in the fourth degree—yet living, who told it in merryment that when the marriage was made betwixt <hi>Franceſco</hi> and her: it ſeemed by the diverſitie of their conditions, a monſtrous thing to thoſe that underſtand not diſparity in matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be a great miſchiefe in the policy even of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity it ſelfe, and conſequently remedies, except it be by a medicine worſe then the diſeaſe, as we ſee among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> and new <hi>France,</hi> and heretofore anciently in <hi>S. Parta. Francis</hi> was a man of a low ſtature; of a broune colour, and of a terrible aſpect. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was of great ſtature, of faire complexion, and of a countenance as humble, and gentle as t'was poſſible. He was addicted to warre, and defiances, ſhe to faſting, and devotion. In which kinde of life (after ſhe was ſet free by the death of her husband) ſhe proceeded ſo far, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a religious habit, ſhe got a fame of ſingular ſanctity: of ſpirit, and of prophecy. From whom as he tooke his complexion and favour (eſpecially in his eyes and face wherein he did marvellouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her) ſo it ſeemes alſo he had his principles of religion, and ſingular piety from her.</p>
            <p>The father died leaving her a widdow with her ſonne <hi>Peter,</hi> and a daughter that was very young, which for charity and honeſty was taken into edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by a brother of the mothers, being the chiefe titular Prieſt of the Collegiate convent of <hi>St. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magora,</hi> upon which occaſion the mother begun to have almoſt a perpetuall converſation among thoſe immur'd hermites of <hi>Saint Hermogora;</hi> where in her life and piety ſhe made afterwards great progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

This prieſt and brother <hi>Ambroſio Morelli</hi> was a man of grave and ſevere behaviour, and very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all kinde of humane literature, whereof he kept a particular ſchoole to teach divers noble mens children both Grammer &amp; Rhetorique. By the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and uncle were fomented in <hi>Peter</hi> thoſe ſeedes of Piety, which after by divine aſſiſtance grew up in proceſſe of age, like that graine of muſtard ſeede, to which our Saviour compared the kingdome of heaven, which is indeed the very piety towards God. But from his uncle he received his firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, together with divers gentlemen, of whom ſome are improved to an excellency of learning; and become grave Senators; (as ſignor <hi>Andre a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſini,</hi> that writer of the <hi>Venetian</hi> hiſtory worthy of eternall memory.) Others are yet living, &amp; give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the felicity of the wit and abilities of father <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom wee now write, who by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a maſter being his uncle, became in ſhort time ſo great a proficient, that he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the more ſolid arts; and greater ſciences of Logique and philoſophy. And the prieſt <hi>Ambroſio</hi> having diſcovered in his nephew a conjuncture, which is ſeldome ſeen of a great memory, with a profound judgment, thought fit to cheriſh the one and the other: becauſe exerciſe either improves, or diſpoſes for actions, and diſcovers, or otherwiſe takes away thoſe impediments which hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of activity. And if mans wit ſeemed to that old Philoſopher to be <hi>Campi Animati,</hi> ſpirited fieldes fit for divers ſeeds, and of unequall ſecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or barrenneſſe. The Prieſt was no leſſe carefull to apply his wit to a right cultivation. Wherefore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98082:8"/>he daily exerciſed his judgement by keeping him to continuall compoſings, holding him to more ſtrictneſſe then was convenient for his childhood; ſpecially being of ſo weake a complexion; And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his memory not only by forcing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate many things by heart, but ſome particulars upon the firſt hearing. The fathers of the convent obſerving in him a rare inclination to learning, reported ſtrange things of his memory. But he told them ſeriouſly, that in that way of exerciſe, his uncle had never made him exceede the repetition of a matter of thirty verſes together out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or ſome author, after a running kinde of reading once over. His carriage of himſelfe even at that age, gave a true preſage of his future deportment, which wee will rather call naturall inclinations, the better ſort whereof he hath ſince raiſed to a great perfection, having corrected the reſt which were more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by vertue, being in himſelfe a meere retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of a ſemblant or meane, alwaies thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and rather melancholique then ſerious, of a continued ſilence even with thoſe of his owne age: alwaies in quiet without, being addicted to any of thoſe excerciſes, wherewith children are by nature moſt pleaſed, (though but in a gentle motion, and only for preſervation of health.) A notable thing, and never obſerved in any other. And ſince then he hath kept himſelfe ſo in the whole courſe of his life, being uſed to ſay upon occaſion, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtand the delight of a gameſter except it were out of affection to <hi>Avarice.</hi> He knew not the pleaſures of the palate, he never long'd for any meate, but nouriſhed himſelfe with ſo little foode,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98082:8"/>that it was a wonder how hee could live; which courſe he hath conſtantly obſerved all his life long, and was never uſed to drinke wine till he was above thirty yeares of age.</p>
            <p>There dwelt at that time in the Convent of the order of <hi>Servi</hi> one <hi>Father Iohn Maria Cappella</hi> of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> Doctor and Theologiſt, eſteemed one of the moſt conſummate &amp; perfect men of his time in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a particular follower of <hi>Scotus,</hi> in whoſe doctrine hee had the fame to have had but few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls. The neereneſſe of their habitations bred an acquaintance betwixt <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and this Father, who upon this occaſion finding the pregnant witt of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> began to reade Logique to him. And becauſe as ſome ſoiles are ſo fruitfull, that upon every little til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, they exceede not onely the hopes, but alſo the wiſhes of the labourer; ſo it happened in a very ſhort ſpace that he made the like progreſſion, paſſing on to the ſtudies of Philoſophy and Theologie, running before all expectation, and the Maſter confeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that hee could teach him no longer, becauſe it happened many times that the Scholler apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a different ſence from his Maſter, was able to maintaine it with ſo much ſubtilty of reaſon, that he made him change his opinion. Whereof, among the notes that are come to my hands, there are many particulars which I ſpare to relate. He began like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his childhood to learne the Mathematiques according to the manner of the wiſe men of old times, tongues, with the Greeke and Hebrew by the opportunity of eminent Maſters that lived at that time in <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by continuall converſation and ſtudy amongſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98082:9"/>them he became deſirous to receive the habit of that order of the <hi>Servi,</hi> either becauſe it ſeemed to him c. life of more conformity to his inclination which was retir'd and contemplative, or otherwiſe being allured thereto by his Maſter.</p>
            <p>It is the property of mans minde in all things that are come to effect, to ſeek no further than to the next cauſes, and particularly in thoſe wherein it is neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt concerned, &amp; ſo ſetling ajudgement upon thoſe alone without regard to an inveſtigable number of other foregoing cauſes in a longer tract; reſolves thereupon to ground the cauſe of his fortune.</p>
            <p>But the Divine providence which orders all things by a connexion of cauſes and effects, guides us to higher conſiderations. The effects following leave us no place to doubt that it was a Divine compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Divine vocation of <hi>Peter</hi> to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe religious, becauſe his Mother, and his Vncle <hi>Ambroſio</hi> the Prieſt having oppoſed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him out of a deſire to make him a Prieſt of their Church, having already put him into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, yet he could not be removed from his firſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, neither by exhortation nor by conſtraint, whereof he ſuffered very much, and at laſt in the yeare 1566. the 24. of <hi>November</hi> he was received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the habit of the Religion of <hi>Servi:</hi> And to what height of learning he was growne in his youth may be argued from hence. That (the day following) there being held an annuall and ſolemne diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of the <hi>Father Minors</hi> of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> called <hi>Sancta Maria de' frati,</hi> he was ſent to diſpute againſt the Theſes that were then given in, where he put the company into admiration of his great and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98082:9"/>ſolid ſpirit, and at the beginning of the diſputations gave them a prettie occaſion to be merry, having forgot himſelfe that he had changed his habit the day before, he did in thoſe actions of curteſie that are common among diſputants (thinking to put off his hat) pull off his hood, and held it hanging in his hand; he continued his Novitiat in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and his ſtudies under the ſame Maſter. And the Father <hi>Benedetto Ferro</hi> yet living and of his owne age, who lived with him in his Novitiat relates of him, That in his childhood he was of great retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſilence and quietneſſe, and that hee was wont to withdraw himſelfe from every childiſh ſport. And they ſpoke it of him as a common by word. All we are for trifles and pamphlets, but <hi>Fryer Paul</hi> is for Bookes: And being now entred into the 17. yeere of his age, and ſetled in a ſtate of profeſſion, but yet ſilently according to thoſe times wherein the decree of the Councell of Trent to that purpoſe was not yet put in execution (for all the regular orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with profeſſions as yet unexpreſt) the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell then intending to provide in that caſe, which was ſhortly made expreſſe in <hi>Cremona</hi> in the hand of the Generall Maſter <hi>Stephano Bonutio,</hi> who was after maſter Cardinall alone in the yeere 1572. about the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> he being then 20. yeares of age when the congregation of the order of the <hi>Servi</hi> Church comprehended about 70. Monaſteries great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and was after raiſed and reduced into two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the one in <hi>Venice,</hi> the other in <hi>Mantova</hi> by <hi>Pius V.</hi> and was governed by Vicars Generall) held a Chapter or generall congregation in the City of <hi>Mantova.</hi> And it is the manner of ſuch meetings of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98082:10"/>Religious men to put themſelves upon ſeverall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exerciſes of preaching and diſputations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the moſt part reſort men of greateſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to honour the meetings, and to give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that they have not ſpent their time in idlenes, but in holy and laudable operations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fryer Paul,</hi> this young man, who (in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) did ſo farre exceede others of riper yeares in ſciences, was commanded to be one of thoſe (who in that honorable concourſe) was to give a taſt of his vertue by anſwering and defending 118. of the moſt difficult propoſitions that were in ſacred Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or naturall Philoſophy (which ſaid charge with how much felicity, with what acclamation and wonder was by him maintained before that venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance may be acknowledged by the ſucceſſe thereof. But there lived at that time <hi>Il ſereniſsimo</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Mantova,</hi> of whoſe glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we finde ſo much witten in Hiſtory. This Prince was a man of excellent parts, and ſo profoundly learned in the Sciences, that it was not eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether his prudence in government or his eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in al the Sciences &amp; arts were the greater, even as low as Muſicke. He had not his wit ſo confined, that while it was applied to learning, it abated any thing of what belonged to the wiſedome of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his people. There was a confluence to his Court (as of a moſt vertuous Prince and liberall Moecenas) from all parts of ſuch as in the Sciences and Arts were of any note or excellency, and they were all received, favoured, and largely entertained; The Biſhop of <hi>Bold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ino</hi> Paſtor of that Church moved by the example of ſo vertuous a Prince, endeavoured
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98082:10"/>to doe the like. His function was meerly eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick, which he attended with all poſſible piety, charity and diligence, and among other things was carefull to furniſh his Cathedrall with a ſufficient lecturer.</p>
            <p>It was worth obſerving, that at the ſame time, the <hi>Duke</hi> taking notice of the great learning of <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Paulo,</hi> made it his requeſt to the Superiors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into the family of the Monaſtery of <hi>Saint Barnaby</hi> of <hi>Mantova,</hi> honoring him with the title of his Chaplaine; And alſo the Biſhop made him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Cathedrall of poſitive divinity, of caſes of conſcience, and of the ſacred Canons. I ſhall not neede to tell you with what wonder of all his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he diſcharged the place, for it may be eaſily believed. True it is, that for divers yeares, and even at this day, amongſt the old fathers; there continues a fame at <hi>Mantova,</hi> and it became a common ſaying, <hi>Non veneramai in un Fra. Paolo.</hi> There will never come more among us another frier <hi>Paul.</hi> At this time in <hi>Mantova</hi> he learned the Hebrew tongue to a greater perfection then he had done at <hi>Venice.</hi> But the occaſion of his converſation in Court: and of ſerving that Prince, made him ſee a kinde of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of underſtanding the hiſtories of the times, wherein he was in a ſhort time ſo great a proficient, that without injury either to times or perſons I may lawfully ſay he was without paralell. In the ſtudy whereof he continued a courſe, which he likewiſe uſed in all his other ſtudies; which was, that when he encountred with any hiſtory or paſſage of learning, or any probleme or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reme. He would never give himſelfe any intervalls
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98082:11"/>but preſently either riſing from the board, or from his bed at midnight, or whenſoever applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly and indefatigably to the ſubject, would never take himſelfe of till he had ſeene what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could be ſeene, which was by confronting of authors, of places, of times, and of opinions, and by a kinde of pertinacity. He would leave himſelfe no occaſion to returne againe to that ſubject, but would be reſolved once for all, how farre the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it could be carried. And his very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends would ſay of him, that in his riper age ſitting downe ſometime upon a Mathematicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, or any other ſpeculation, he would continue there in making figures or numbers a whole day, and a whole night together, without leaving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he could ſay <hi>O, l'zó pur vinta opui non ci voglio pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare.</hi> I have either overcome it, or elſe I'le thinke no more on't.</p>
            <p>Divers accidents befell him during his abode in <hi>Mantua,</hi> where among other converſations which he had in that City, he tooke the greateſt pleaſure in diſcourſing with <hi>Camillo Olivo</hi> who had beene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to <hi>Hercules,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> (that had beene legate in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for a perſonage of great piety and learning. But nevertheleſſe a man that could not fly from his ill fortune, becauſe the Cardinall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving incurred the indignation of <hi>Pius quartus</hi> (for ſome things which concerned the councell) thoſe crimes from which greateneſſe had priviledged the maſter, came to be charged upon the ſervant; who by the Inquiſitours was much troubled, and kept long in priſon, after the death of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98082:11"/>Lord, from whence although he had a free delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe the Pope himſelfe lived not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he could never make his reentry into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore lived a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life in <hi>Mantua.</hi> The chiefe pleaſure that <hi>Fryer Paul</hi> tooke in concourſing with him was: becauſe he found him a man of ſingular moderation, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by being with the Cardinall at <hi>Trent,</hi> had had a great manage in thoſe actions: knowing the particularities of the moſt ſecret buſineſſe, and had beſides many memorialls in peruſall, whereof <hi>Friar Paul</hi> tooke much delight; Becauſe the conciliary action being newly diſſolved (which by ſo long a courſe of time had held all Chriſtendome in ſo much expectation) and (ſpecially men of high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and intellectuals) in whom it begot a great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie to know how things had really paſt, of all which he had taken notes with his owne hand. He had like wiſe a very neere familiarity with the father Inquiſitor, of the Dominican order, <hi>Fra. Gilolemo Bernerio da Correggio,</hi> who was after made cardinall of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> by <hi>Sixtus V.</hi> of the congregation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, and protector of the order of the <hi>Servi,</hi> with whom he continued ſervitude till his death.</p>
            <p>How much he eſteemed <hi>Fryer Paul,</hi> ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hereafter where it may be more neceſſary. All perſons of learning that came to that Court, had a deſire to confer with him, becauſe he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gotten ſo forward in all the ſciences, that he did not onely give all men ſatisfaction, but left them with ſo much wonder of his profoundnes in every thing (being yet but young) as if he had beene verſt in that alone, and applyed himſelfe to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98082:12"/>nothing elſe. And the ſervice of that Prince ſeemed to require no leſſe. Becauſe as perſons of divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions reſorted to his court, ſo he was deſirous that his chaplains ſhould treate and hold argument with all men of all things that fell into diſcourſe. And he himſelfe would ever propound ſome extravagant queſtion, &amp; at publique diſputations, where he would appeare ſometime unexpected. He uſed to command <hi>Fra. Paul</hi> to argue to ſome concluſion, wherein it was impoſſible he ſhould be premeditated. As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others at one time (which may ſerve for an example of many) in a Theologicall Theſis that Chriſt our Lord died at the age of three and thirty, being a ſubject to puzzell any indifferent wit. But <hi>Frier Paul</hi> with confronting the evangeliſts by their Eaſter, as if under his eye he had had the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the Goſpell, and with ſome allegations out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> did to the wonder of all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, reduce his reſpondent to ſo narrow a ſtreight, that he was driven to ſay of <hi>Euſebius, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria eſt non vera narratio,</hi> whereat the Duke breaking into a laughter, replyed. Father, thoſe of <hi>Saint A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi> of the living and of the dead, are hiſtories to you, and ſuch like as are ſold by the Mountebanks. And ſo in a kinde of whiſpering and jeering the diſputation was broke up.</p>
            <p>Nature at ſome certaine times produceth wits that are apt for any particular ſcience; as in many ages after wee ſee not the like againe. Many ſuch and very famous ones have beene in former times. In this of ours <hi>Vieta</hi> in the <hi>Algebra, Gilberto</hi> in the ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Magnetique vertues, <hi>Galileo</hi> in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the motions. The braine of <hi>Fra. Paul</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98082:12"/>to have a rare excellency in all theſe: but in the Mathematiques it was a thing incomparable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever remaines of antiquity, or of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne writers, was but the leaſt part of what he knew. He was no leſſe curious to know all that had beene ſaid of the Aſtrologiques, the vanity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utility thereof he did alwayes, and abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, becauſe things in futurity either cannot be knowne, or cannot be avoided. But not long before his going from <hi>Mantua</hi> there happened a pretty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. The Duke who willingly interpoſed the pleaſures of wit and facetiouſneſſe with the grave cares of his government, tempering wiſely his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with Joviality of words and actions, had in his ſtable (whereof by the example of his anceſtors, he kept a race of ſo great eſteeme, that it is reported that at the battell of <hi>Pavy</hi> 15.25. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt king of <hi>France</hi> was there mounted upon a horſe which had beene given him, by the Marquiſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi> And <hi>Charles</hi> the fift in his warres made uſe of another of the ſame race which was beſtowed on him; I ſay this Duke <hi>William</hi> had a mare that was in fole of a mule, and being neere the time of her foling, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Fra. Paolo</hi> to beſtow a nights ſtudy with Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall inſtruments that the horoſcope, &amp; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale minute of the beaſt might be knowne with the ſcituation of the Heavens, and the poſture of the ſtarres at that time: which being done, and reduced into the forme of a figure or apoteleſme, the Prince cauſed copies to be ſent abroad to all the famous Aſtrologers of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as in other places, with this declaration; That at ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time a baſtard was borne in the Dukes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98082:13"/>houſe, and I can very well tell that a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prince made himſelfe merry to reade the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digents that came from divers parts. One would have this baſtard to be a Cardinall, others that hee ſhould be a great commander; others, that it prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated triumphes, or miters even as high as the very Pontificate.</p>
            <p>There came rumour which got ſome credit, and is not yet extinct: That <hi>Fra. Paulo</hi> taking diſcontent at this action, was willing to leave the Princes ſervice, fearing leſt at ſome time or other by the Capricio's of the Princes braine, a worſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might befall him: and to ſay truth <hi>Frier Paul</hi> commended much the excellency of the Princes wit; but withall had obſerved ſome toyiſh fancies wherewith he was too much pleaſed. But he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſeriouſly affirmed, that this was no cauſe of his departure, nor yet the example of another Fryer of the ſame order called <hi>Cornelio da Codomo,</hi> who being likewiſe entertayned by the Duke had incurred his diſpleaſure, and was put in priſon, from whence he made his eſcape, leaving a generall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the great meanes that were uſed to catch him againe, that he meant to put him to death. But hath alwaies rather confirmed it; That the Duke had all the reaſon in the world. And the Duke did honour him ſo much as to give him an account of the buſineſſe and the writing it ſelfe which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, (and I have ſeene it) which moved this great Prince to ſo juſt a diſdaine (and this it was) That when the Cardinall <hi>Hercules de Gonſaga</hi> dyed, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne young man that qualified himſelfe to bee his ſonne, not conceiving that he had quick juſtice done
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98082:13"/>him by the Magiſtrates in the execution of certaine goods pretended to belong to him, did in the forme of a ſupplication deliver the Duke a reall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Libell, taxing him to be an uſurper and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Tyrant, threatning him with divine revenge, and citing him before the tribunall of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being impriſoned, hee confeſt that it was <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelio da Codomo</hi> that had formed that ſcandalous writing.</p>
            <p>Fame bore it out, that theſe two were the cauſes of his departing the Court, to which the courſe of time gave ſo much credit, that it is yet received for a truth among the elder ſort, though it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly falſe. But the true cauſe of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which hee made with the Princes favour and approbation) was, becauſe that a court life was ſo abſolutely averſe to his Genius, and his fame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion made him to be perpetually importuned by his friends and ſuperiors, who had a deſigne to make uſe of his labours in their profeſſion. <hi>Fryer Paul</hi> had added to his learning ſuch an integrity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious carriage, that being but a very young man hee was had in reverence of all men as an Idaea of modeſty, of Piety, and all other vertues both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Morall. Some things may ſeeme para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, but they are ſo well knowne, and have ſo great a teſtimony from men yet living, that hee that ſhould goe about to queſtion any of them muſt needs have put on a vizard of impudency poyſoning his tongue with untruth, and his corrupted heart with malignitie of paſſion.</p>
            <p>Let Fryers ſpeake, let ſo many Senators witneſſe, whether <hi>Fra. Paulo</hi> were ever heard to ſweare by his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98082:14"/>faith, or ſpeake an unſeemely word: or ever ſeene to be angry, yet theſe are not the onely ſingularities of his later times when was he a ſervant to the ſtate of <hi>Venice;</hi> but theſe and others have beene in him from his youth in ſuch a perfection, that he never had any publique correction as was uſuall with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of religious orders. He was never reprehended for ſpeaking an undecent word, nor doing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming act. It was a marvellous thing how in ſo young a man that had not exceeded the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two, ſo many ſciences (in ſo high a degree) ſhould be united; beſides thoſe that are ordinary in them that live in Cloiſters are (after literature of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie) the logique, Philoſophy and Theologie. But to thoſe, he had alſo joyned the knowledge of the lawes, perfectly of the common law, and more then meanely of the civill, all the Mathematiques and medicine, the knowledge of ſimples, of Hearbes, of or Plants, of Mineralls, with their tranſmutations, a ſufficient underſtanding of divers tongues, beſide the latine, the Greek, the Hebrew, and the Caldean. All which learning together would have had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of monſtrous in it, though it had been found in a maturer age, but from the holineſſe of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he received ſuch a ſplendour that even in that Spring of his yeares he did prognoſticate what ſtore and perfection of fruite might be expected from him: if it ſhould pleaſe God to reſerve him for further times. Although it be as true, that the knowledge alone of all that which humane underſtanding can raiſe it ſelfe to makes not a man perfect, though it may render him admired: Nay the devills them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are knowne for their great wiſedome, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98082:14"/>have a name of mighty knowledge. But goodneſſe is that which gives the forme, piety, religion, and the vertues of the minde are the ſoule of this body. And the accumulation of ſciences, and probity made this religious young man ſo venerable, and (I may ſay) ſo majeſticall, that as it is a cuſtome in <hi>Venice</hi> among the noble, and ingenuous youth, that if any of them be not ſo decent in their habite, or that they be of a leſſe modeſty in diſcourſe or cariage, then they ought to be, yet when they appeare before the firſt Senator, they are carefull to put themſelves into their beſt habite and poſture, ſo in this order of the religion of <hi>Servi</hi> (for even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the religious, eſpecially thoſe of the younger ſort, are not alwaies under rule, nor as wee ſay with their bowes bended,) yet at the appearance of <hi>Fra. Paolo</hi> they were all compoſed reducing themſelvs to a more ſeriouſnes of behaviour, ſetting aſide both ſport and Joviality, as if his onely preſence had been the black rod; whereupon it became a proverbe among them, whenſoever he was preſent or appeared. <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Such power hath the preſence of a man of knowne probity &amp; innocency: even over the behaviour of others: yet nevertheleſſe he was ſo pleaſing, ſo humble with all men, that hitherto I have not knowne that man that could ſay (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when he was in the publique imployment) that he had received a ſharpe word, or ſeene a geſture from him expreſſing rigor to others, (although with himſelfe) he were moſt ſevere.</p>

During which age and a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he had never taſted wine, except it were at the Celebration.

He went at that age to <hi>Millan,</hi> and it happened in a time when <hi>Cardinall Borromeo</hi> (at this day <hi>Saint Carlo</hi>) was in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the reformation of that Church, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reduced the confeſſours by a rigorous zeale to ſo ſmal a number (which either was becauſe he found them very ignorant) or underſtood of great abuſes committed in the adminiſtrations of penitence, whereof he cleerly purged their Churches. This great paſtor had found the meanes to know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the life and quality of the Cloiſters, as it appeared by ſo many that tooke their heeles, &amp; tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not for his judgment. It may be well imagined what intelligence he held with <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> whom he ſent for, and againſt his inclination made him heare confeſſions, making uſe of him not onely in the Church of his owne order, but in others (as it was needfull) and tooke great affection in him, being much pleaſed with his company. He would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be preſent at the moſt difficult diſcuſſions of caſes of conſcience &amp; other conſultations upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers accidents, where the opinion of the moſt learned divines were had, and would often make him ſtay to dine with him in his refectory: becauſe that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> in imitation of thoſe ancient holy paſtors.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98082:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and others, did frequently make a common life and table with thoſe of his clergie.</p>
            <p>At that time, and before his departure from the province of <hi>Mantua</hi> by that of <hi>Venice,</hi> as it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing, that how vertuous and innocent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man be, he cannot be without trouble and emulation; being complayned of to the holy office of inquiſition by one <hi>Maeſtro Claudio Piacentino his contemporary,</hi> but one that was unable to raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his ſtudy and vertue to that credit which <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> had, and therefore thought to equalize him by pulling him downe. But it proved much to his owne diſadvantage, becauſe howbeit the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor received the accuſation and formed the proceſſe, yet in fine, the father would not anſwer, but appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Rome</hi> about the formation of the proceſſe, whither (the cause being called) after many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and receipts, It was concluded, that the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor ſhould have a heavy reprehenſion with a <hi>taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>ignorance.</hi> And indeed it could not well be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: The accuſation being that the father, who well underſtood the Hebrew tongue, had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that from the firſt chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the moſt holy Trinity could not be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; whereupon he oppoſed the Judge, not onely becauſe he agreed with his accuſer, but becauſe he was not able to judge the cauſe, as having no knowledge of the Hebrew Tongue. And as ſoon as the cauſe was ſeen at Rome, it was thrown out of the Court, without ſo much as calling the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be examined, but onely by giving a checque to the Inquiſitor. In this very time there was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his naturall weakneſſe two other infirmities,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98082:16"/>which he hath endured for many years; becauſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as wee have ſaid) with an extream ſlenderneſſe of diet, and drinking nothing but water, and many daies not at all; and when thirſt invited him, hee went to the pit, and drank onely once, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fell into ſuch a coſtiveneſſe, that although it may ſeeme ſtrange, yet it is very true, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily hee ſtaied three daies, ſometimes a whole weeke, before thoſe naturall parts which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to expell the excrements could doe their office, and with ſo much more paines, becauſe it was accompanied with the diſeaſe of the <hi>Hemoroids,</hi> which by the long and violent force bred the falling downe of the ſtreight gut, accompanied with a Flux from the Liver, which hath remained with him even to his old age. Upon this occaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the preſcripts of Phyſitians (with whom hee converſt rather to diſcourſe of their art, than to make uſe of their Receipts, having formerly made a good progreſſe in that Science, wherein hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came marvellouſly excellent, and among other things it was an exhortation of his friends to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to drinke Wine. But to that he never rendred himſelfe, till after the thirtieth year of his age, nor then but with much averſneſſe; nor ever in fourty one years which he lived after, could hee take any liking to wine, except it were white, and that onely for the reſemblance it hath to water, and amongſt other things which he ſaid hee had repented himſelfe in his life time, this was one, that hee had been perſwaded to drink wine.</p>
            <p>Naturall affections may be ſometime moderated, but I can hardly beleeve that they are ever extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98082:16"/>There are very few men that have been able to command themſelves: But peradventure it will not be eaſie to find any one, who generally, and upon all occurrents was more a patrone, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of his affections than he. If once his judgement preceded, nothing was ever ſufficient to remove his reſolution, no kinde of meate could ever move his appetite, if he thought it dangerous, nor Phyſick would hee take, otherwiſe then hee took delightfull food, if hee believed it to be good for him. And ſo in all other things, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he was uſed to ſay, that he never overcame any thing with more difficultie, than forſaking water to drinke Wine. But partly by his complexion, which was of an incredible meagreneſſe, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his additionall infirmities, hee could never be made beleeve, that hee could live a yeare to an end. This is witneſſed by all thoſe that were his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, that if he did not compute every day for the laſt, yet at leaſt he computed every yeare, contrary to thoſe that uſe to ſay, There is none ſo old, that he may not hope for a year of life; And hee ſaid, hee never remembred himſelfe ſo young, that he could hope for a yeares life. To this it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he having made a progreſſe above all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, in his ſtudies, whereunto he was ſo devoted, that very few daies paſt in his private life, wherein hee ſtudied not eight houres, although he would never write any thing for publication un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he were conſtrained by a publique neceſſity. And in his actions among his friends (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would ſay) he never appeared active nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but cold and reſerved, becauſe he that hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98082:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>no hope of life, ſeldome applies himſelfe to actions of any great conſequence. And nevertheleſſe the affaires of his owne province, and the inſtance of his friends, were able to cal him backe to his owne Country in <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; his province, where immediatly, al thoſe that were of greater yeares giving place to an eminency of vertue, and integrity, more to be admired then rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he being already gone through all thoſe degrees which the lawes of his order had appointed; of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, of Bachelor, of maſter, (which is the title of the Doctorates in <hi>Theologie</hi>) and being a yeare before that, aggregated to that moſt famous Colledge of <hi>Padua,</hi> was with univerſall applauſe 1579. created Provinciall, (with this addition that he ſhould governe the ſtudie as regent) for ſo they call the readers of the ſacred Theologie.</p>
            <p>That great Prince, who at his death deſired an applauſe from his friends that ſtood about him, gave us to underſtand, that in every vocation whoſoever carried himſelfe well ſhould not be defrauded of his due commendation. The dignities among religious men, being conſidered either by their profit, or their ſplendour are not things to be ſtood upon; but to ſuſtaine the change of them with a due charitie and prudence, is more then can be performed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In theſe things, <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> chalkt out a way to his ſucceſſours, by which they might arrive at their end with great reputation. In matters of judgment he gave them all an eſſay of an inflexible rectitude, and that which he ſtrictly obſerved all his life long, was never to receive a donative (how little ſoever) never to admit any other proceeding in matter of juſtice but with acceleration, and expedition.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98082:17"/>No judgement of all thoſe of his (which were innumerable) were at the inſtance of any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judgement, found fit to bee repealed. And I ſhall ſay this particular more by way of anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Cardinall <hi>Santa Severina</hi> (for reaſons that may bee alledged) ſhewed himſelfe very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that certaine ſentences which the Father had given againſt ſome that were forward in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals favour might be retracted, and having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the proceedings to be well compared with the relations of his auditors, was conſtrained to confeſs, that in point of juſtice, it could not be otherwiſe, nor better determined.</p>
            <p>In his government he baniſhed all factions, and particularities. None had ever cauſe to complaine of him, except it were ſome indifferent friends, that promiſed themſelves more of his friendſhip than they had reaſon.</p>
            <p>He left his Province with ſuch orders and cuſtoms as (if they had been obſerved) had prevented a greater deale of inconvenience, wherewith they have been ſince afflicted. This (as the beginning of his employments) diſcovered a fraught age of prudence in the manage of buſineſſe, and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of government, which (with age) was increaſed in him to ſuch an excellency, that in ſo great an heape and innumerable number of affaires that paſſed through his hands, none were ſo involved in difficulty, but that his more than humane wit found a way to the head of it, either to diſſolve it, or to ſhew that it was inextricable. And as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſome famous Chyrurgeons, that where they ſet to their fortunate hands, no wound prov'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98082:18"/>ſo to him, there were brought from all ſorts of people the moſt arduous buſineſſes, with this confidence, that either hee would preſently finde out the knot, or that no man elſe could ever have the hope to doe it. And although it have ſeemed to ſome, that his inclination ſtood rather to ſeveritie and rigour, than to clemency or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet that proceeded rather becauſe he was of a ſerious and retired diſpoſition, than any way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile or joviall. But he was really of ſo compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a nature, that hee would neither doe injury himſelfe to any, nor ſuffer another to doe it. And this, either goodneſſe of nature, or tenderneſſe of affection, had ſo rooted it ſelfe in his ſoule in his graver age, that as it chances not onely in naturall things, but in his affections (above all other) the exceſſe whereof had not only extended his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards men, but to all other ſorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Inſomuch as his nature could not endure that any thing ſhould be grieved or moleſted. And if it had been needfull to kill any of thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with his own hand, which God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for food and ſuſtenance of life, true it is, that in the latter years of his life (excepting a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity) hee would rather have abſtained and faſted. But becauſe he had formerly cut in peeces a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of living creatures with his own hands to make Anatomies, whenſoever he fell into the occaſion of that diſcourſe, he ſeemed to reſent it with a kinde of compaſſionate diſpleaſure and reluctance: And if in diſcourſe or writing, he ſeemed at any time more punctuall in matter of juſtice, nothing being able to make him decline from the ſtrict courſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98082:18"/>(blaming often the too great mildneſs of punitive juſtice) as an occaſion of much and many abuſes: yet withall, if it had concerned himſelfe to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it, I am very well aſſured that in all his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and many years ſuper-intendence of his province, you would rather have diſcovered in him a defect of rigour than of mercy.</p>
            <p>But in the adminiſtration of his owne charge, what a reputation of integrity, piety, and prudence, and of every vertue he had gain'd to himſelf, it may be gathered from hence. He was made provinciall of his order at the end of the twenty ſixth yeare of his age (which was never conferred upon any ſo young as he) by any information that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neither before nor ſince, in 340. yeares that this order of the <hi>Servi</hi> had had a beginning. In this year of 1579. there was held a generall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the whole order in <hi>Parma,</hi> and becauſe about tenne yeares before, by many Statutes made at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and by the Popes themſelves, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Secular Friers, as alſo by the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was reſolved to be neceſſary to make new conſtitutions and rules for the government of the whole order. It was therefore decreed at that Chapter, for the deferring no longer of ſo good a worke, that three of the moſt learned, pious, and prudent men, ſhould be choſen out of all the order of that religion to execute a buſineſſe of ſuch importance, as every one which well underſtands that knows what belongs to Government. One of theſe was <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> who was but a youth in reſpect of the venerable and hoarie haires of the other two. Upon this occaſion hee tarried a good while at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98082:19"/>home where he made a diſcovery of his moſt rich Talent to the cardinall <hi>Alexander-Farneſe</hi> Protector, and to the other <hi>Santa Severina</hi> Vice Protector of the order. The charge that was particularly layd upon him, was to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate that part which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the ſacred Cannons, the reformations by the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> which were but newly come forth, and the formes of their judgments. All the worke lay upon the three that were deputed, but becauſe he had a more exquiſite knowledge of the Cannon and civill lawes, and of the Conciliary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, the buſineſſe of that particular was wholly remitted to him; and he alone gave forme to that whole part which treated of judgments in accommodation to the Clauſtrall ſtate, and that with ſo much brevity, cleerneſſe, and profundity, that thoſe judges that were ſo knowing and onely exerciſed in matter of judicature, have admired it as the action of one that had conſumed his age in nothing but ſtudy of the Iawes of that order. And it is an argument to convince the errour of thoſe that beleeve, that they which give themſelves moſt to the ſtudy of ſciences, are thereby rendred unable for government and policy. It being an error every way as groſſe as it is pernitious. Whereof wee ſhall give a lively example in the following courſe of the life of father <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaving at <hi>Rome</hi> (by the occaſion of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) a great fame of his knowledge, and prudence, not onely in the Courts of theſe two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, (from whom by order expreſt in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Briefe of <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth.) It was appointed that all ſtatutes which were made ſhould
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98082:19"/>receive approbation. For it was ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reſort to, and treate with the Pope himſelfe; From which burden being now diſcharged, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his owne government.</p>
            <p>When he had ended this charge of Provinciall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and eaſing his ſhoulders of ſo great a weight, he entred into ſome more quietneſſe, which he ſaid was all the repoſe he enjoyed in the whole courſe of his life, becauſe nothing fell out in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the evills were not well diſcerned, or elſe were growne tolerable without factions or diſcontentments. And as a weary man reliſheth his reſt with more ſweetneſſe: ſo for three whole yeares he gave himſelfe to nothing but ſpeculations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things. And his knowledge in them being growne to ſome perfection, he paſt further to opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his owne hand, in the tranſmutation, and diſtillation of all ſorts of mettalls. Not that he was ever toucht with the vanity of the poſſibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gold, or that he thought a diſcreete man could any way engage himſelfe in ſuch an inquiry. Of this it may be an argument, that at that time (for many monthes together) there continued in <hi>Venice</hi> (after he had travelled <hi>Italy,</hi> and deluded ſo many Princes and Prelates) That famous impoſtor <hi>Mamugna,</hi> who was beleeved to make gold, which expreſt very well the ſence of <hi>Diogenes</hi> when he ſaid (he did not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate from the vulgar no not Kings themſelves) Becauſe into that credence, or rather into that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, the vulgar did not onely ruſh with ſuch an exceſſe of confidence, that they called all men miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants that did not beleeve the making of gold. Yea <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> Princes, the Pope himſelfe, <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98082:20"/>ſo great a Prince, and of ſuch knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, had given out that he would queſtion the ſtate of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> for giving protection to ſuch an Impoſtor if his knavery were not diſcovered. The father <hi>Paul</hi> made it alwaies a matter of Jeſt, and to ſome of his friends that would have carried him to the experiment, he alwaies anſwered, that if he ſhould do ſo, they would not onely repute him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, but eſteeme him for a very foole. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his intimate friends (with whom he had conference concerning this Impoſture) were ſome gentlemen who, relying upon the fathers judgment, were the inventors of a Maſcherada to expreſſe his opinion. One clothing himſelfe like the <hi>Mamugna,</hi> in a boate with fire and coales, and bellowes, and and glaſſes, and other chymicall tooles went about the citty crying, <hi>Al Magmugna Atre lire il ſoldo del loro fino.</hi> who buys a ſhillings worth of of fine pure gold for nine pence! And one of theſe is at this day a moſt excellent Senator of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe ſingular life, &amp; vertue deſerves a recomendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a better occaſion. The father uſed to mocke thoſe that told him they had ſeene him make gold, and would alwaies ſay, why now wee ſhall ſee what the <hi>Chaus</hi> had wont to ſay. There being at that time in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> one of thoſe <hi>Nuntios</hi> that came from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about affaires; whom they called a a <hi>Chaus.</hi> And this <hi>Chaus</hi> having heard of this man that he made gold, made no other anſwer to it (but by a Laconicall brevity which is uſuall with that nation) <hi>Il gran ſignore dumque verra aſervirlo.</hi> If you make gold the great Turke ſhall come to be your ſervant. And the father who ſo willingly held
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98082:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>argument with any that profeſt diſtillations, could not be ſatiſfied how the humour of gold could be made entrant, becauſe al his exerciſe was only for the knowledge of nature. Wherein the great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of our age can teſtifie the greatneſſe of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and of the many things of his finding out, which were communicated to others of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, wherewith they have honoured themſelves; there being no admired effect, no occult propertie; nothing either written or experimented: which he had not either ſeene or examined. And beyond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane beleefe he was verſt in all the things of thoſe arts, in ſo much as men thought he had employed his whole life in nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>About that time, and long after he exerciſed himſelfe in the anatomy of all ſorts of creatures, and for the moſt part of living creatures which he uſed to cut up himſelfe: particularly the anatomy of the eye, wherein he was ſo perfect, that <hi>Aqua-penden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> did not diſdaine to alledge in his reading, nor in his printed book the authority of father <hi>Paul.</hi> And that famous man when he ſpoke of him, he ſpake as of the Oracle of that age. Beſides other learning, he was much verſt in the knowledge of the propriety of ſimples, of the nature of mineralls, in ſo much as in thoſe profeſſions whatſoever he knew not, was not cognoſcible. But ſuch as are well informed of the truth, have made it a rationall wonder, that as <hi>Aqua pendente</hi> in his tractat <hi>de viſu</hi> in genuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſeth, that he had learned from him the manner wherby in the Cryſtalline humour viſion is made by refraction, and that he was the firſt obſerver that the tunicles of the eyes were dark and thick (as all the reſt) but that they onely became diafa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98082:21"/>tranſparent by being continually drencht, and moiſtened with a cleere humour, as the nature of Cavernes in Mountaines and rocks renders the earth tranſparent, which is of it ſelfe moſt darke and duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky by a continuall irrigation (as wee may ſee in pibbles and flint-ſtones.) And more over how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion by art makes barke of trees and ſhells and rootes tranſlucide, which of themſelves are of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and denſitie. So the whole tractate concerning the eye which paſſeth under the name of <hi>Aqua-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente,</hi> or at leaſt ſo much as conteyns new &amp; rare ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations &amp; experiments, is the work of <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> wherof I have had ſpeech with ſome that were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, and knew that a due part of the praiſe was not attributed to him that deſerved it all. But much more in another matter of more moment which was the finding out of thoſe <hi>valvule,</hi> thoſe inward ſhuts or folds that are within the veines. Of which argument I doe not finde, that any, either ancient or moderne hath made mention, becauſe it was a thing unthought of till theſe times that <hi>Aqua-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente</hi> moved the queſtion at a publique Anatomy. But there are ſtill living many eminent and learned Phyſitians, among which are <hi>Santorio</hi> and <hi>Pietrou Aſselineo</hi> a French man, which knew that it was no ſpeculation nor invention of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendente</hi> but of the Fathers, who conſidering the gravitie and weight of the blood, grew into opinion that it could not ſtay in the veins, except there were ſome bunch to hold it in, ſome folds or ſhuttings, at the opening and clofing of which there was given a paſſage and neceſſary <hi>Equilibrium</hi> to life. And upon his owne naturall judgement he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98082:21"/>to cutting with more exquiſite obſervation, whereupon hee found out thoſe <hi>Valvuie,</hi> and the right uſe of them, which doe not onely ſtop and hinder the blood from dilating it ſelf by his weight into the veines (as wee obſerve in ſome crooked and ſweld knots, but alſo that blood running up and downe with ſo much liberty, and in ſo great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity) it might eaſily ſuffocate the naturall heate of thoſe parts which ought to receive their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it. And in conſequence he made diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that the Athletick Habit, which in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and according to <hi>Hippocrates (bonitatis ſummum attingit)</hi> had no other cauſe of being ſo dangerous and deadly, but becauſe the blood being in ſo great a quantity in the veines, might hinder the uſe of thoſe <hi>Valvule,</hi> whereby of neceſſity followed ſuffocating for want of ventilation. Of this hee gave account to ſome friends of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and eſpecially to <hi>Aqua-pendente,</hi> who made very great uſe of it in a publique Anatomy, after which divers famous Authors have written much upon that ſubject.</p>
            <p>But me thinks I ſee alwaies the very geſture of the good <hi>Aſſelenio</hi> who when he takes occaſion to ſpeake of the father, lift up both his hands, ſhruggs his ſhoulders, and hanging his head on one fide (to ſpeak it in a kind of a French phraſe.) <hi>Oh how many things have I learned of Padre Paulo in anatomy, in mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, &amp; ſimples. This is a pure ſoule in which there ſhines a Candour, an excellency of nature, &amp; an ignorance of doing any thing but well.</hi> A father being moſt a famous phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of of <hi>Orleans,</hi> had a ſonne whome he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be of his owne profeſſion, and bred him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98082:22"/>in ſuch a way, that at nine yeares practiſe he begun to worke in diſtillations. And although in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and Anatomy he be ſecond to very few, yet I believe him to be before all others in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſimples of mineralls, and of their vertues and uſes for mans body. He came very young into <hi>Italy,</hi> being ſent thither by his father to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from the danger of the civill warres in <hi>France</hi> which were then very violent. And being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> he fell in love with the place as a Country of benignity to all travellers, and had no minde to leave the place, where he exerciſed the profeſſion of Phyſick, rather as a friend with his friends, then for gaine, having done many cures that were miraculous when he wrought alone, but not willing to ſhew his talent among others, becauſe by nature he was averſe from contending or making any oftentation. This man from his very arrivall took converſation with the father, which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with a moſt holy friendſhip preſerv'd betwixt them for eight and thirty yeares. And he more then any other can ſpeake of the fathers wondrous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the foreſaid profeſſions, and of things by him invented, whereof an intire volume might be written.</p>
            <p>But being not like to continue long in this holy and vertuous quietneſſe; the fame of his prudence and hability of government, after three yeares drew him away (and as I may ſay) from that garden of ſpirituall delights, into a thorny field of toile and wearineſſe of ſpirit and body, and at a generall Chapter he was by common conſent created Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of the Court called Proctor generall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98082:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is the ſupreame dignity of that order under the Generall, and in thoſe times that religion flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with learned men, none were aſſumed into that order except men of exquiſite prudence, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the charge beares with it a neceſſity to defend all the variances and controverſies at <hi>Rome,</hi> that are promoted in all the religion, beſides the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of appearing in all courts and congregations to maintaine the cauſes that are brought to the court) and of ſingular learning to be able to pray before the Pope upon daies that are deſign'd to that order. And becauſe the Proctors of Court are much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Popes in the congregations as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a publique lecture upon wiſdome.</p>
            <p>In theſe three yeares that he dwelt in <hi>Rome,</hi> beſide that incomparable prudence wherwith he treated of matters of religion, there was knowne to be in him a great aptneſſe to greater things, and by order from the Pope himſelfe he entred into divers congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where there was occaſion to diſcourſe in occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent actions upon important difficulties of doctrine. At which meetings he came to know and take intimate acquaintance with father <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who was often preſent, and was afterwards a Cardinall, whoſe friendſhip continued even to the end of his life. He knew there likewiſe the Doctor <hi>Navarro,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome</hi> about that famous cauſe of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and he was wont to tell with a great deale of delight that he had many times had diſcourſe with one of the ten compagnons of father <hi>Ignatius</hi> who then lived. And I believe it was father <hi>Bobadiglia,</hi> wherein I ſhould be ſorry to be miſtaken. Onely it is remembred that he found
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98082:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>him often doing his exerciſe in certaine remote pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that he ſeemed to be full of holy ſimplicity, and that he told him freely at one time, that it was never the minde of the father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be reduced to what they were now, and if he returned into the world he ſhould not know them, being become a quite other thing, and ſo much changed from what he left them.</p>
            <p>How he behaved himſelfe towards the Cardinall <hi>Santa Severina</hi> protector appears in this, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone among ſo many that were imployed, went away in his good grace and favour, which was no ſmall matter with a Prelate of his diſpoſition, who was uſed to call thoſe that went according to his by as, without contradiction, poore ſpirited fellows and flatterers, and thoſe that made lively oppoſition againſt him, &amp; ſpake their minde undauntedly; them he hated for being too free and inſolent. But above all he was entred ſo far into the grace of <hi>Cardinal Caſtagna,</hi> who was after Pope, by the name of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſeaventh, and ſucceeded <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. that he was infinitely pleaſed with him. And t'is very like that this Prelate (being of a more then humane meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of life, moſt innocent, and for his carriage irreprehenſible) the ſimilitude of their diſpoſitions might be the cauſe of uniting their affections. The father never viſited him, but by the cheerefullneſſe of his face he might diſcerne that his viſite was ſo much the more accepted by how much it was more frequent. And after his going from home, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies continued to be his ſervant. The ſhort time that he lived in the Pontificate, which was onely thirteene dayes, gave no aſſurance how his favour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98082:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>would have continued to the Father after his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to that Throne; for this very opinion that he had of the Father to bee a ſubject of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable learning and ability (I have this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from one that was preſent when the newes was brought him of his death) that he ſaid without any ſhew of alteration; <hi>Ideo raptus eſt ne malitia mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taret intellectum ejus.</hi> He had once occaſion to goe to <hi>Naples</hi> to ſit Preſident as Vicar Generall at the Chapters, and to make the Viſitation, where hee grew acquainted with that famous witt <hi>Gio. Battiſta Porta,</hi> who in ſome worke of his that came to light makes honorable mention of <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> as of no ordinary perſonage, and particularly of his ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſpective. The time of his Office of Proctor Generall in Court, happened to be at the beginning of the Pontificate of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the ſift, who (as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, having been a Fryer, knew much of the worth of thoſe religious perſons that were remarkable, and among others having had information of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Father) gave him imployment in congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and other manages more frequently then was uſuall. He was preſent at the diſcuſſion of that matter: Whether the Duke <hi>de Ioyeuſe</hi> being a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin were diſpenſable, and to that purpoſe were ſpoken (by thoſe that would flatter) ſuch exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances of the untimely power, or rather the ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall omnipotency, that Father <hi>Bellarmine</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent told the Father in his eare: Theſe are the things that have made <hi>Germany</hi> revolt, and will produce as much in <hi>France,</hi> and other Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Upon a time the Pope being in the ſtreet in his Litter, called the Father unto him, holding him a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98082:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>good while in diſcourſe, which was nothing elſe but of certaine memorials that were come to his hands againſt the Generall of that time. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted paſſage, and obſerv'd by the Court that uſed to make obſervations upon all things, was preſently divulged abroad how much the Father was in the Popes favour; what would you have more? The vanity had already made him a Cardinall. But this favour which was neither ſought nor deſired by him, caſt him into a moſt troubleſome perſecution. At his going from <hi>Venice</hi> he had left his friends at the Councell, and directions of maſter <hi>Gabriell Colliſon,</hi> with whom hee had formerly joyned in the taking away certaine ill cuſtomes, and grievances which ſome ſuperiours had impoſed upon others that were weaker then themſelves, and were deteſted under the odious name of Tyranny. But as it often happens, that what we deteſt in others, we are ready to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in our ſelves, and the nature of <hi>Gabriel</hi> being (as it was afterwards diſcerned) to bee onely a friend and lover of his owne intereſt: In thoſe three yeares of the Fathers abſence from the Province, hee had gotten an abſolute Dominion whereto he had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd and maintained himſelfe by very great extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: one onely impediment was a mighty traverſe to him, that the Father was ſhortly to returne to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> to whom he knew ſuch practiſes would bee no waies pleaſing; and he was out of hope of inclining him to thoſe courſes of his, becauſe he had had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his integrity, &amp; that he was not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. He conceived his onely remedy was to make him a propoſition, againſt which the wiſeſt men can hardly make a defence (which was) the way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98082:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>and therefore to remaine at home. And began ſeriouſly to perſwade him by letters, engaging ſome of his deare friends to propound it to him: That the credit which hee had got at court might make him a way to the advancement of his fortune. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among other rejections of that Counſell, and to be troubled no more with thoſe arguments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him by a letter in cypher (which was uſuall betwixt them) wherein were words of diſcredit caſt upon the Court, as if dignities were obtained by ill meanes, and for his part, hee made ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of honour ſo gotten, that he did rather abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it; Maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> kept the letter, and cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and after three yeares end, that his office was expired, the Father returned home to his Country, to his quietneſſe and to his ſtudies, but was not able to approve the extortions which <hi>Gabriel</hi> had uſed in the Province, wherein he was maintained by the favours of ſome Courtiers of the <hi>Cardinal Sancta Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verinas Court,</hi> who did not favour him gratis neither, (it being kept upon very good account) that the Generalſhip, whereunto hee was at laſt preferred, ſtood him in no leſſe then 40000 duckets) as there are many that can very well make the computes and tell the particulars,) all of it being taken out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens purſes, wherein the Father alone declaring himſelfe not to approve, and leſſe to conſent to thoſe courſes of his, they came at laſt to a rupture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt diſſention, wherein that hee might prevaile being already crept into ſo much favour at Court that it was a wonder, and particularly to ſee the Cardinall Protector, who was then chiefe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office of the inquiſition, to whom the letter with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98082:25"/>the Cipher, was preſented, who did not thinke it fit to proceede againſt the father by way of the holy office (as maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> hoped he would have done) yet nevertheleſſe he ſhewed an implacable indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him. And as the multitude are uſed to turne on that ſide where the winde blows faireſt, although he had reduc't himſelfe to his quietneſſe without medling any further with matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe he ſaw the diſeaſe was growne incurable: yet nevertheleſſe he was much troubled (although not in his owne perſon) wherein neither art nor violence could ever finde the leaſt defect (whereupon to attacque him:) but in ſome of his friends who being not exempt from ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, were not onely made incapable of degrees and honours, but every venial ſinne of theirs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be a mortall vice. And <hi>Santa Severina</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe employed even the authority of the holy office againſt them, by meanes ſo ſtrange and ends ſo baſe, that I dare not mention what I have heard, for feare it might give the world too great a ſcandall; In which way of proſequution this is all the remedy that can be had, that ſuch as are ſo narrowly in quiſited may in their recourſe to <hi>Rome</hi> with their commiſſions finde Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Among the fathers great diſturbances (whereof wee ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake hereafter) this was one. There was one <hi>Fryer Julio</hi> an old confeſſor, who being of an irreprehenſible life, had much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him to confeſſion: with a notable emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of almes.</p>
            <p>This man from the firſt entrance of <hi>Fryar Paul</hi> into Religion (having beene his mothers confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98082:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>undertooke to keepe him ſo far as belong'd to his clothing, and the expence of his journeyes and bookes; becauſe the father to the very laſt of his lif would never have more then one ſimple garment, ſo that if he had fallen into the river he muſt have kept his bed till that had beene dryed againe. He never had any ornament of chamber, and ſo he hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the expiration of his ſoule, his moveables being onely a portable quadrant of Chriſt in the garden, a crucifix with a naturall deaths head at the foot, as his peculiar looking-glaſſe, and three houre glaſſes of ſand to take meaſure of his time. He never had of money more then was neceſſary for a dayes uſe. And this <hi>Fryer Julio,</hi> till he was ſo old that he began to loſe the vigour of his intellectualls, kept him meanly clothed and onely according to neceſſity. The Monaſtery alwaies ſupplying him, with what was neceſſary and convenient for his garments, and other neceſſarie expences. In fine, the father was never put to provide for him ſelfe while he was under the care of this good old man. It is not to be doubted that the tranquillity of the mind hath a principall foundation in the internall parte, in a profound knowledge of divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, without which every externall thing is inſufficient and vaine, becauſe a man that is once dejected, cannot be ſuſtayned nor held up by any of thoſe things. Although it cannot be denied but that externall helps may adde ſomething to quietneſſe. Now to diſturbe the father in the contentment which he had (without wearineſſe) in thoſe poore mentioned neceſſaries, and ſeeing that as a ſquare figure is immoveable in every poſture, ſo they apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98082:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>themſelves to an experiment, whether in the perſon of this nurſing father of his he had any ſenſe, and by diveliſh informations they firſt moved the Patriarch <hi>Priuli</hi> to deprive him of his faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, thereby to ſhorten the father of his wonted, but poore, and yet <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> allowance.</p>
            <p>And this courſe they held, that the Patriarch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into ſome pretences with the Hermits of St. <hi>Hermagora,</hi> who by their perpetuall retiredneſſe, or rather impriſoning themſelves, were found to be in ſuch a reputation of holineſſe, that they needed no other defence. They gave that Prelate to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>Fra. Julio</hi> who had beene confeſſor, and miniſter of the holy maſſe and communion to them for many yeares, was the man that went about to excite ſuch as were devoted to him; and others of the prime nobility to oppoſe themſelves againſt him; And it went ſo far that the buſineſſe was repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Rome</hi> as a diſobedience, and from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors Court, where they held intelligence, they produced a letter that ſerved to their purpoſe, and ſo they tooke away <hi>Fra. Julio,</hi> and ſent him out of the dominions (as far as <hi>Bologna</hi>) after he had dwelt at <hi>Venice</hi> in high eſteeme of honeſty, above five yeares. <hi>Charity</hi> towards the poore man made <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> take a journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obteyned the returne of his innocent father againe to <hi>Venice,</hi> whither he himſelfe alſo returned ſhortly after his wonted ſtudy, and exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Wee are not to concurre in opinion with ſome Philoſophers, that our ſenſitive and mentall faculties are pure and meere poſſibilities, becauſe, holding that opinion it would not follow what fortune
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98082:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>were a good encounter, either to have a better or a worſe complexion, or temperament of nature. And it is moſt certaine, that the temperament and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion have a great part in the habilities or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of men. The father had his ſenſes the moſt ſubtile and of the greateſt vivacity that were poſſible to be found in any, eſpecially his eye being of a moſt quick and ſharpe ſight. His taſte moſt perfect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was able to diſcerne things that were almoſt inſenſible. But in compounded meates it was a wonder how quickly he was able to diſtinguiſh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the benefit or the danger, diſcerning infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the one from the other; whereof when there was occaſion, and that he knew by certaine evidence, and reaſons, that it concerned him to have a care to prevent poyſoning; he would not onely not ſeeme to have the leaſt diſlike or ſuspition of any thing, as one that knew by proofe, that thoſe are mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly preſerved that are in Gods protection, but beſides for as much as might concerne humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he held himſelfe ſecure, that in his meate the exquiſiteneſſe of his ſenſe, would give him notice, &amp; in his drinke, where the greateſt danger lay, he held a more watchfull care. This exquiſitenes or paſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſenſes reflected upon his minde as by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whereby it was a thing to be admired, that every thing tooke impreſſion, and ſtucke with him ſo tenaciouſly; when he entred into any place or roome, all the images or formes of the leaſt things he carried away imprinted in his memory: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion his friends would aske him how it was poſſible he could take notice of ſuch pretty things. If he read a booke (and he uſed to read all of any
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98082:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>account) that came forth, he knew all, and could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the very leafe where he had obſerved any thing though of very little moment. But with me it happens otherwiſe, when in bookes I cannot finde, or elſe go ſearching for what I know; and many times I skip it over, at leaſt in a kinde of ſtudy, which they call <hi>Studium vagum,</hi> a wandring ſtudy. But in him no ſuch diſtinction was knowne, with whom every thing was fixt. And the thing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wonder was, that all impreſſion being ſo eaſie with him, the cancelling or loſſe of it as difficult. And with theſe excellencies he had ſo much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that he would grant it no otherwiſe to any that praiſed him for that perfection, then to tell them that they praiſed him for a great imperfection, and for an excellent weakneſſe: which in all other things was prejudiciall to him, for he would ſeriouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he employed no greate care in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or other obſervations, but that his great paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and imperfection was the reaſon of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And to thoſe that argued it to be a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the retentive was ſo eaſie and ſtable, he would reply, that it ſhewed a weakneſſe, and a greater paſſibility, becauſe not onely the object in him was mooving, and conſequently inferred paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but, every little relique, and Idea of the object, continued it.</p>
            <p>But this probleme we leave to others to diſpute of. From hence, and from his perpetuall ſtudy, (wherein both before and after hee had laid down Magiſtracy) he had ſo plunged himſelfe; I beleeve his exquiſite knowledge was rayſed.</p>
            <p>It is was an admirable thing that he did not only
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98082:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>underſtand the Canonicall lawes, and decrees, but that hee knew the times when every Canon was made, the fountaines from whence they were drawn, &amp; the cauſe which had moved the making of them. In the matter of Benefices which is ſo intricate, ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo many relations, he knew all the reaſons controverted, the progreſſes, changes, and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But with this Theorie, he brought from home with him all the practiſe of ſo many congregations and tribunalls as are there, with their preſidents and their proceedings. And which is yet more ſtrange; hee had as it were painted in his memory the places, ſituations, the figures, the ſtatutes, and whatſoever he had at any time ſeene remain'd as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed with him. But howſoever from this either paſſibility or imperfection of temperature (as hee called it) or ſublimity or felicity of underſtanding as others eſteemed it; (and not from any ſtudy of Phyſiognomy that hee was ever knowne to make,) there was bred in him that great knowledge which he had of perſons; In which kinde of knowledge I cannot truly finde in all courſe of time, that there is mention made of any that knew ſo much as hee. And if I ſhould tell you the particular ſucceſſes (as many times from beholding but the faces of men) but moſt of all from one ſingle conference or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, (as if they had had the little window in their breaſt which <hi>Momus</hi> ſo much deſired) how far he could penetrate into the nature, the cuſtomes, the inclinations, and carriages of men, I ſhould be affraid that with pure truth I ſhould take away the credit of what I write. But this neceſſity of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things ſo minutely (though either he were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98082:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>not willing, or cared not much for it) yet in length of time it had reduced him to ſuch a ſubtilty of judgment, that even in the religon &amp; among the Fryers themſelves there grew a report (which fince <hi>Malevolent</hi> people have augmented in his latter yeares,) that he had a familiar ſpirit. A vanity which hath no need of confutation. From this roote ſprung that marvellous way of treating with all ſorts of perſons to their ſatisfactions, becauſe hecould immediatly penetrate the nature, the inclination, the deſignes, and like a perfect Muſitian make his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſtrument by the firſt touch: ſo by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men ſpeake, he knew their ends, their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, their drift, their reſolutions upon buſineſſe, and with moſt admirable quickneſſe, the very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that they could make; And he regulated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo in all his proceedings, that having treated with him of all qualities of perſons, of Princes, of ſubjects great and meane ones, ſeldome any man left him without admiration, but both by conſent and conceipt it was the teſtimonie of all that father <hi>Paul</hi> was an eminent perſonage. From this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine flowed that quickneſſe of knowing immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what anſwer to make to all perſons in al matters that were propounded to him. Whereof I would bring you ſome proofes if ſo many hundreds, and thouſands of perſons yet alive, had not ſeene the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (and as I may ſay) not in a few but in all things.</p>
            <p>In hiſtories both ſacred, and profane he raviſht men into admiration of his anſwers, by the very places, the times and occaſions, and preciſe acts, as if his fancy had beene the very ſcene where he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98082:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>had ſeene them acted. There have happened to come to <hi>Venice</hi> in our daies divers <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> in ſeverall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. One from beyond the mountaines (who had made exquiſite ſtudy in the properties of the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, believing) and with very good reaſon (that he knew as much as any other) was admitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the father, and finding that he could not alledge neither ſpeculation nor experiment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the father was not as knowing, and much more then he both in his reaſons, and the fabricke of his inſtruments, he became ſo much amaz'd that he had forgotten where he was. The moſt rare inventions of inſtruments, engines for meaſures, for weights, for horologies, for mathematicall and military u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and for all purpoſes were brought to him to ſee, and thereof to give his opinion, a thing to be admired, how as if he had underſtood nothing but the Mechaniques, he would preſently comprehend the deſigne, and give judgment whether it would ſerve for the thing it was intended for; or not, with the meanes how to better it, how to facilitate, and make another like it, with what oppoſitions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. But they ſay more of him, thoſe that brought him inſtruments to ſee with what facility he told them what they were made for; ſaying. This inſtrument is to take a ſcituation, or to meaſure a voyage, or to lift a great weight, or to know how to returne to unknowne places by the ſame way they came. The particulars would make a volume. <hi>Signor Alfonſo Antomini</hi> a Cavaglier of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime vertues morall, civill, politique and military that can any way render a gentleman amiable; after he had beene in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> to ſee the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98082:29"/>warres, and ſo likewiſe with obſervation in others as with exerciſe of his owne perſon, and eſpecially of his wit in obſerving all things, was raiſed to ſuch a degree of military knowledge as very few have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to, and was called back by the moſt ſerene Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> to doe them ſome ſervice concerning the commotions that were then in <hi>Italy.</hi> But thoſe being fallen into a condition which might rather be called rumors of warre then open warr, and not obtayning a libertie to depart to any place of reall wares, gave himſelf to a remeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he had formerly obſerved, eſpecially the orders of the <hi>Prince Maurice of Oranges,</hi> and withal to ſe what <hi>Plobyus</hi> &amp; ſome other authors, wherein he might know the orders of the ancient <hi>Romane</hi> mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and of other people, and upon this occaſion wrote a booke how a preſent militia might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged. But having conceived in his minde the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many inſtruments and military engines; he was deſirous to goe to <hi>Venice,</hi> to have conference with the father, and to impart his thoughts; and and receive his judgment therein, and being acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally fallen upon the ſubject of glaſſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives, in which ſtudy <hi>Antonini</hi> had lately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his witts, the father did not onely diſcourſe with him <hi>ex improviſo</hi> upon the fabrick of many ſorts of glaſſes and of their effects, which ſeemed to to have ſome thing miraculous, but preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pen and paper gave him the figures in forme with their demonſtrative reaſons, as if he had come newly from ſtudying. <hi>Halazen,</hi> or <hi>Vitellio,</hi> and others of that profeſſion, although he was able to give a true account, that it was above fortie yeares fince
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98082:29"/>he had beene verſt in any of thoſe authors.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my diſcourſe, he being come from <hi>Rome</hi> to his reſt, and to his ſtudies, returned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to his vertuous converſations, and all the time that he could ſpare from divine offices, (wherein he was alwayes conſtant, when not hindred by publique imployment) and never omitting his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, he ſpent at his booke. About that time he wrote ſome of his owne conceipts, naturall phyſicall, and Mathematicall, which when he tooke a review of afterwards, he made no account of, and was wont to ſay. Oh what childiſh things paſt through my minde? And I am very certaine, that if they had beene ſeene by learned men, they would not have deem'd them childiſh. His quietneſſe then begun to be a little diſtracted by an accident that happened in religion. It was a common expectation in the religion that a <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> who was thought to deſerve well ſhould be made generall; But the great Duke of <hi>Toſcany</hi> oppoſed it, and by his power at <hi>Rome</hi> cauſed a <hi>Bologniſe</hi> borne at <hi>Budri</hi> to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Generall, who was a reader in <hi>Piſa</hi> of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques. This was a man of great learning and goodneſſe, but not able ſo for government as was needfull, to ſuſtaine ſuch a charge in times of ſo great factions and diſcontent. And very ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there flew ſuch memorialls and advertiſements to <hi>Rome</hi> concerning his ſimplicity, and the crime of his companions, which were all laid to his charge, that favour failing him by the death of the great Duke <hi>Franceſco</hi> which happened 1587. <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. and the <hi>Cardinall Santa Severina</hi> Protector concurring both in one minde, which was not to favour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98082:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>that man in his office of Generall (becauſe he was inclined another way) reſolved that his cauſe ſhould come to examination. And after a long time of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about the deputation of Judges by the <hi>Cardinal Santa Severina</hi> becauſe the religion was then in factions, and what one man propoſed another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, at laſt the Pope who had taken knowledge of <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> undertooke to determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and commanded him to goe thither to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the buſineſſe. So he was appointed to goe to <hi>Bologna</hi> where he continued many monthes in the treaty of that troubleſome cauſe. Becauſe the Generall having obtained that advertiſement of the proceedings, ſhould be given from time to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of <hi>del Torrone</hi> there being alſo before him at that time ſome Crimininall cauſes of of importance and it was in the publique priſon they ſate; whe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they fell often into differences of what was fit to be done. For ſatisfaction whereof it had beene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to write, and to expect reſolutions from <hi>Rome.</hi> And it was well worth obſerving, that in all the controverted <hi>Points,</hi> the opinion of the father was ever approved of, notwithſtanding the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelves uſe to be the moſt conſummate and and abſolute men in matters of judicature. But the proceſſe and the cauſe were both determined by the death of the Generall, although ſome ſentences which the father had given againſt ſome of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſtood unrepealed.</p>
            <p>The father being come back to <hi>Venice,</hi> reſumed the courſe of his former ſtudies, and of his retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from bufineſſe frequenting his accuſtomed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous converſations, and the reſort that was to the houſe of fignor <hi>Andrea Moreſim</hi> (whom we name
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98082:30"/>before) being growne very numerous, and frequent becauſe there came thither a great part of ſuch as profeſt learning, and not onely of the nobility whereof ſome ſubjects are ſince riſen to be great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and like ſtarres in the firmament of the moſt ſerene Common-wealth for goodneſſe, Religion learning and civill prudence; but there were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe admitted into that meeting, all ſorts of <hi>virtuoſi,</hi> as well ſeculars as religious, beſide the moſt eminent perſons of learning that were then met at <hi>Venice,</hi> or in <hi>Italy</hi> or of any other nation that did not faile to be preſent in that place, as in one of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated conventions that had ever beene conſecrate to the <hi>Muſes.</hi> In my life I have not ſeene more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exerciſes, and I wiſh it had pleaſed God that as the vertues of thoſe two <hi>Andria</hi> and <hi>Nicolo</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (which diſcended by inheritance unto their nephews) ſo there might have beene in <hi>Venice</hi> ſuch another meeting, where there were met at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times five and twentie or thirtie men of rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. At this meeting the ceremony (which is a thing ſo much affected in our times and ſo ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) had no countenance which tries the braines of the wiſer ſort, &amp; vainely ſpends ſo much time in an an artificiall kind of lying, that ſignifies nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſignifies ſo much, but a civill and free confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was onely there in uſe. It was allowed every man to make his diſcourſe of whatſoever pleaſed him beſt, without reſtriction of paſſing from one ſubject to another, provided it were alwaies of new matter, and the end of their diſputation was for nothing elſe but to finde out truth. But the felicitie of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was rare, who upon any ſubject that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98082:31"/>did not onely diſcourſe without premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but made no difference of ſuſtaining or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning any propoſition in a ſcholaſtique way. All which he did with ſo much facilitie that it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a wonder in all men. And afterwards in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, when he was put in minde of thoſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he would ſimile at them as at puerilities. At this time the civil warrs in <hi>France</hi> flam'dout, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was pleas'd to heare ſuch as could diſcourſe of them. And that pleaſure continued with him to his lives end, to heare and underſtand any thing of the ſtate of the world, and how things were carried. This was a generall Idaea with him, wherein he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome failed in his judgment, if any newes that were ſpread abroad, was either true or falſe, that upon things preſent he would ſettle a judgment with ſo much prudence in relation to what ſucceeded, that it made men wonder and ſeeke after his opinion, as if it had beene a prognoſtication. And for as much as at the golden ſhip in the merchants ſtreet there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meete a ſont of gallant and vertuous gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to recount their Intelligences, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; among which the good <hi>Perrot</hi> a frenchman, (whom for his candour and civility, beſides his firmeneſſe in religion, they called the true Iſraelite, alluding to that Saying of our ſaviour. <hi>Hic eſt verus Iſraelita in quo dolus non eſt</hi>) thither alſo came Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that were ſtrangers, and ſuch as had not onely beene over all <hi>Europe,</hi> but in the eaſt and weſt Indies, and the father among others found meanes to be among them. And as in that minde of his every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing tooke impreſſion, ſo he had likewiſe an admirable dexterity to make other men enter into diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98082:31"/>
Himſelfe was in all his life time of very few words, but pithy and ſententious, acute without ſcoffing, ye he tooke great pleaſure to make men ſpeake and with a dexterity, like <hi>Socrates</hi> delighted to make diſcovery of the abilities that were in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this he called, to make them deliver themſelves, or to helpe them to bring forth. And the dexteritie aroſe, not onely from being verſt, but conſummate, and made up in all ſorts of learning, becauſe he was able to follow every one, in his own element. Phyſitians in medicine, and Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in the Mathematiques, and ſo in all other things. And upon what ſubject the diſcourſe fell, he that knew him not very well, went away perſwaded that that ſubject was his principall profeſſion and maſter piece. And when he met with any perſon that was eminent in any art or ſcience, he would take occaſion to aske him queſtions with an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable mildeneſſe, till he had drawne out of him what was poſſible to knowe, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any importunity or troubleſome curioſitie. But his greateſt pleaſure was to diſcourſe with thoſe that had beene abroad, &amp; would give him a true relation of countryes, of cuſtomes, of people, &amp; of religions, having himſelfe alſo had an extreame deſire of pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination. <hi>Signor Bernardo Sichini</hi> patron of the ſhop, where they uſed to meete, had among others a ſonne (that yet lives) of a wit far above the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that he followes, both becauſe he had ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Lovaine,</hi> and beſides, nature is not ſo malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and partiall as ſhe is accuſed to be, but produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth many time in perſons of meane fortune, wits that are of a great eminence and capacity. With this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98082:32"/>man, the father entred a great familiaritie, which continued betwixt them till death. And in this he ſeldome failed, when he met with any man, that had knowledge or practiſe in forraine countryes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at larg with him. Thus much I obſerve by the way, that the fathers acquaintance in this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in 1586. about one and twenty yeares before the differences fell out betwixt the moſt excellent common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> V. after which there were invented ſo many calumnies, and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which drew a prejudice to the Merchant, in his trading. And thereupon he begunne to withdraw himſelfe from that company. But <hi>Signor Alniſe</hi> would never give his conſent, preferring the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of the father, before all or any detriment, that could befall him. This was the time wherein the father had the greateſt happineſſe and the moſt quiet enjoyments of his life. Becauſe although he had three great infirmities which were bred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him, and with which he made account to be accompanied to his grave. The flux from his liver, the falling downe of the ſtraite gut, and a periodicall or intermittent headach, beſide the trouble of the Hemorroyes, all which were by him ſupported with ſo much cheerefullneſſe, and ſerenity of heart as if he had beene the ſoundeſt man in the whole world, and he reputed them divine favours and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall admonitions of the diſlodging, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his ſoule muſt ere long make out of her earthly manſion for any thing elſe it may be ſaid that he thought himſelfe to be in a garden of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and to tread upon roſes. Becauſe for matter of want he knew none, having no deſire of an thing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98082:32"/>being moſt rich in his povertie, without money without induſtry how to advance any, without thoughtfullneſſe, having left al his cares to father <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulio</hi> &amp; without books (except ſuch as were daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed him by his great friends, which he had read all over, and had made in his underſtanding the greateſt library that any Prince in the world had, beſide the unfurniſht nakedneſſe of his chamber, with the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of his diet, which was ſent him from the Monaſtery, being to him moſt plentifull. All his life was onely employed in three things; the ſervice of God; the time which he ſpent in his ſtudy and in converſations. In this courſe he was conſtant, never failing to be preſent at divine officer. To his ſtudyaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his private devotions he dedicated the morning which he begun alwaies before ſun riſing, but for the moſt part, he prevented the morning, untill the houre of common ſervice. The afternoone time was divided either into operations by his owne hand, and tranſmutations and ſublimations and ſuch like, or into converſations with his friends that were learned, and other famous perſons in <hi>Venice</hi> or elſe ſtrangers that reſorted thither.</p>
            <p>The ordinary place of their meeting in <hi>Venice</hi> was at the ſhop of <hi>Sechim.</hi> And in <hi>Padua</hi> whither they often tranſported themſelves, was the houſe of <hi>Vicenzo Pinelli,</hi> which was the receptacle of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and an Academy of all the vertues in thoſe times. And what an eſtimation <hi>Signor Pinelli</hi> had of the father the ſucceſſe ſhall ſhew, whereof there are yet living teſtimonies which I know by name. The good <hi>Aſſilineo</hi> the french man before named, and the <hi>Signor Sechim.</hi> In the company of <hi>Signor Pinelli</hi> was oftentimes <hi>Monſieur Perrot</hi> a Frenchman, worthy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98082:33"/>of eternall fame for integrity, and the <hi>Signor Marmo Ghetaldi</hi> a moſt principall gentleman of <hi>Ragouſe,</hi> whom I believe to be ſtill alive, knowne of me both at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> an Angell in his behaviour, and a devill (I underſtand this name onely in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) in the Mathematiques, His <hi>Apolomus redivivus,</hi> and other workes of his that are in print can eaſily teſtifie, that he hath either none or very few equalls. The father coming by accident to viſite <hi>Pinelli,</hi> who at that time was prickt with a naile of the gout, and yet made a great ſhift to goe forth to receive him, as he did after, when he went away to beare him company; where at ſome that were preſent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a wonder to ſee ſo much honor done to a Frier <hi>Ghetaldi</hi> deſir'd to know who that man was, to whom ſuch an extraordinary reſpect was expreſt. To whom <hi>Pinelli</hi> made anſwer (I relate it in his owne words) <hi>il Miracolo de queſto ſecolo,</hi> and <hi>Ghetaldi</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding further in what profeſſion, <hi>Pinelli</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him; In whatſoever you pleaſe. And obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to be entred into ſome admiration. He added futher; <hi>Signor,</hi> I know your excellency in the Mathematiques, let us make ſome tryall of him, Ile invite him with you to morrow to dinner, be you in a readineſſe with ſome propoſition of ſuch a ſcience, as you think may ſerve for a touchſtone of tryall; and in the meane time ſtudy to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and ſo you may be ſatisfied concerning his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. I will be the proponent, and will ſeeme to underſtand nothing of you, till wee come to the waſhing of our hands, and accordingly the buſines was carried. I could not attaine to know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular probleme or Theoreme, nor what it was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98082:33"/>that <hi>Ghetaldi</hi> brought into the field, but I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd that at the diſcourſe of the father; he was ſo much aſtoniſht and confus'd, that he confeſt, he ſhould never have believed, a man could have knowne ſo much in any profeſſion; whereupon he deſired to become his intimate friend, and to confer all his inventions with him, and ſo much of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques as he hath ſince conſecrated to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And likewiſe the good Perrot tooke an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, which continued till he paſt to a better life: which he willing to teſtifie in his laſt ſickneſſe, left him by his will his ſilver Ewre, with which he uſed to power water upon his hands. But the time was now come, when the pureneſſe of the gold ſhould be tried by the touchſtone. It pleaſed God, who guides thoſe that are his, by toyleſome wayes, that now he ſhould be drawne out of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his reſt, into the tempeſtuous ſeas of new troubles, which happened in this manner.</p>
            <p>The favour of the Cardinall <hi>Santa Severina</hi> (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the order of the <hi>Servi</hi>) had at the inſtance of the Cardinall of <hi>Medici</hi> (who was afterward <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. &amp; of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>) preſented to be General, one maſter <hi>Lelio Baglioni</hi> a Florentine, a man truely of a great vivacity, being bold &amp; learned, and more then all that, of an unblameable carriage, and when he preferred him to that dignitie, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his intention to him, defiring him to coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with him, that when he had finiſhed his courſe in the office, maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> might be his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the place. The generall (as it is uſuall with all that obtaine ſuch a dignity) to have two ends the one to continue in the charge as long as they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98082:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>can, and when they are neceſſitated to leave it, to make a ſucceſſor of offer their owne choice) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Cardinals declaration of himſelfe into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration, although ſecretly he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to traverſe it by all the meanes he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And becauſe the ordinary ones were too little purpoſe, as to ſay that he was a ſubject without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, without merit, without any learning, ſince the continuall preſents and bribes, that <hi>Gabriel</hi> gave in the Cardinalls Court, and the favour with his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> and with the Cardinal himſelfe did preſently diſperſe thoſe thinne clouds like a North me winde, and were ſo far from not ſuſtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that they were more like to have Canoniz'd him; He tooke another courſe which was more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to make it knowne in Court to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reformation which was over the Regulars, and to the Pope himſelfe, that maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> was a vicious and facinorous man, culpable of great crimes. And he went yet further to divulge it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the Court, that whatſoever profit he could raiſe in making ſpies, in any lawes proceeding, in ſoliciting cauſes, or any thing elſe that was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible in another and much more in a man of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that pretended to a Generallſhip, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of which practiſe were all brought home to the Protectors Court. This divided the poore religion of the <hi>Servi</hi> into two factions, the heads of which were, on the one ſide maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> among the fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Cardinall abroade, who being impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently intereſſed (by <hi>Lelius</hi>) carried himſelfe with more paſſion, then any of the Fryers; and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Generall with his abbettors, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98082:34"/>not his ſeconds, being like quickſilver, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing to publiſh all occurrents, as well in the Courts of the Cardinalls, as of the Pope himſelfe: amplifying the extorſions that were brought into the Cardinalls Court; and in particular complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the Protector had taken all the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Generall, to the end that favour and Juſtice might onely be expected from maſter <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who made them venall to furniſh the Court with preſents. A thing that made the Cardinall ſtarke madde, by reaſon of an humour then raging under <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth who had made ſo many bulls <hi>Contra munerum largitiones,</hi> which is a miſchiefe in Court like judicial aſtrologie, whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Semper vetabitur &amp; ſemper retinebitur</hi> (Factions in Religions being a diſeaſe of humanity, are not ſo eaſily ſhakt off by entring into Cloiſters, but that it happens many times, that under the titles of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, many miſchiefes are concealed.) The <hi>Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> and <hi>Neri,</hi> the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibelines</hi> had not been ſo fierce againſt each other, but that by a neceſſity they were linkt ſo neere together in their Citties, in their houſes, &amp; in the ſame geniall beds. And among the Regulars they have got a cuſtome (which was uſed in <hi>Sparta</hi>) that both parts firſt make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their neutralls. The innocent father had enjoyed a vertuous quietneſſe, and had oppoſed theſe differences as long as he was able, but it was neceſſary for him now to declare himſelfe of one ſide. And being no longer with his honour, and by his former declarations, to approve of the extorſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rapines which maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> had uſed to ſupply his bribes at <hi>Rome,</hi> became preſently united
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98082:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>in intereſt with the Generall; And although it were his chiefe deſire, either to have have ſweetned the bitterneſſe, or reduc't things to civill termes, which in order of Religion are ſaid to be done by votes, &amp; ſuffrages: yet he could never bring that to paſſe. For now maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> reſolved to accuſe him of criminalities, making it a matter againſt him in the Inquiſition at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had held commerce with the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and to foment the quarrell the more, he drew out the letter (which wee told you of before,) with the counter cypher, and ſtirred up a nephew of his at <hi>Venice</hi> to doe as much againſt him there as was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> making this his ground, that they being on a time upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of compounding differences, the nephew ſhould make anſwer that he believed the faction of his uncles part was much the ſuperiour, becauſe at their Chapter they had an expectation to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the holy Ghoſt; and that thereupon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould replie, that it was fitter to operate by humane meanes upon this <hi>Maeſtro Santo</hi> (for ſo was he called) accuſed him to the holy office at <hi>Venice,</hi> that he had denied the aſſiſtance of the holy ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But that Tribunall having examined teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that were preſent at the treaty, thought it no Juſtice, ſo much as to call the father to his anſwer, but extinguiſht the action without ſpeaking a word more of it. But at <hi>Rome</hi> that point of the letter with the Cypher brought the father into a very ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was an enemy to their greatneſſe, but in ſecret, they neither durſt nor could tell, how to frame any thing againſt him upon judgment of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I have heard ſome ſay at ſundry times, I know
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98082:35"/>not whether I ſhould cal him ignorant or malignant, that repreſented it as an irrefragable argument againſt the integrity of the father, that he had beene thrice denounced to the holy office of the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in his youth by Maſter <hi>Claudio da Piacenza,</hi> and in his riper age by maſter <hi>Gabriel,</hi> for that letter in Cypher againſt the Court, and this laſt time by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtro Santo</hi> his nephew: as if to be denounced were ſo great a marke upon him. And truly, if the doctrine of faith or religion had beene in queſtion, it had beene capable of no excuſe. But to this oppoſition, and to theſe men that conſider not ſo much the end of judgment as the beginning of a trouble; Let them take their anſwer from <hi>Padre Maffeo</hi> a Jeſuit, who tells us in the life of Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> (now canonized for a ſaint) that he was nine times put into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, (if I erre not in the number) but with this difference, that the <hi>Saint</hi> was called, examined and abſolved, and this father of ours three onely times, but never called nor examined. And then let 'em tell me, what ſtrength is in that argument of theirs that it ſhould follow, either that the father was not right, or that the Magiſtrate was not juſt in receiving ſuch accuſations. But concerning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with heretiques, although nothing was proved, yet it tooke a very great impreſſion in <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the eight, who remembred it againſt him a good while after. In ſo much that the father being propoſed to the Biſhopricke of <hi>Nova,</hi> although the Pope confeſt him to be a man of learning, and of great capacity, yet he added that he deſerved no preferment from the Church, for the practiſes that he had held with heretiques. All which had no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98082:36"/>other foundation but this, that the Citty of <hi>Venice</hi> being ſo great, that it drew from all parts of the world, no tonely by reaſon of the buſineſſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice, but alſo ſuch men as have any reliſh of things that are curious, and fit for admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And the father being there at that time in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of one of the moſt learned men in the world, the profeſſors of ſciences that came not onely from <hi>Italy,</hi> but from other regions, and chiefely the greater perſonages, that eſteemed it a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their travell, to ſee and hold diſcourſe in matter of learning, with one that in all profeſſions, was not only able to give them ſatisfaction, but to ſend them away with wonder, &amp; he that knew not onely termes of humanity and civility, but the moſt ſtrict Canonicall rules oblige not to avoid the company of any, except he be by name and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually condemned by the Church; He without any further ſcruple thought all ſorts of ſtrangers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his vertuous converſation. Sometimes he came into company by command, as when <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur D'eureux</hi> afterward Cardinall <hi>Peron</hi> came to <hi>Ro.</hi> where he had the firſt time unſuccesfully treated the reconciliation of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Perron</hi> paſſing by <hi>Venice,</hi> there were deputed to beare him company, the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Linigi Lollino,</hi> after Biſhop <hi>Bellano, Peerleſſe</hi> in humanity and the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, and the father alſo ſpent many dayes with him, and almoſt alwaies in diſcourſe either of ſtate matters or of learning. And this great braine of whom it is reported that he ſhould ſay that in <hi>Italy</hi> it is well knowne that in <hi>Padova</hi> in the houſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98082:36"/>of <hi>Vincenzo Pinelli</hi> and upon other occaſions he found few perſons of notable learning, he celebrated the father for a tranſcendent wit. And it was upon the ſame occaſion that <hi>Lollino,</hi> and the father, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into commendation of the great knowledge of that Prelate, and his extreame wiſdome in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and confounding thoſe whom he diſputed with, eſpecially in religion, he told them againe in modeſt language, that he had not onely found the <hi>Hugonets</hi> in <hi>France</hi> without learning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge eſpecially in the old fathers in councels and Hiſtorians, but he had likewiſe found them Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke and impatient; whereupon beſides matter of doctrine, whenſoever he diſputed with any of them, his chiefe ayme was by ſome picquant words or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guteneſſe to put them into choler (and that being done, he was aſſured to carry the victory. And truly that elevated ſpirit of his had that naturall aptitude and inclination (obſerving alwaies in his diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about religions tenents that are in print) an argute manner of diſputing and extreamely provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative. Occaſions of this kinde were very frequent. But paſſion, and ignorance (which in this age) have rendred Religion like the Dye of factions, and the deſire of envious people to give intelligence at <hi>Rome</hi> thereby to appeare more zealous then other men. So ſoone as they ſaw any man appeare to viſite the father, that was uttred all, <hi>Oltramontana,</hi> like a <hi>German</hi> or a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> immediatly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him to be an heretique, like a fellow that denounc't his preacher to the holy office, becauſe forſooth having cited the prophet <hi>Habacuc,</hi> he ſaid he knew him to be a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> becauſe of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98082:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>the beſt ſyllable cuch. But divine providence by ſuch gradations as theſe, began to inure her ſervant to the injurious calumnis of that government, which in the progreſſe of his life for being a faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the divine Majeſtie, to his Prince, and to the holy church, were prepared by an higher hand for the tryall of his unconquered, and conſtant piety, and for proofe of an heroick patience.</p>
            <p>The domeſtique turbulencies endured many yeares with an implacable ardour on both ſides, wherein the father had occaſion enough to ſhew his moderation in reſtrayning the violence of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, his mildneſſe in never giving offence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body (although himſelfe offended) the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; ſerenity of his ſoule that never loſt himſelfe upon any wretched ſucceſſe, nor tooke pride or too much confidence by any thing that fell proſperous, as of neceſſity it happens with others after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, although they be but buſineſſe of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. His ſingular prudence in redreſſing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was in his power for accommodation, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the ſweetneſſe of an incomparable minde which was never ſeene to be angry, nor ever to reſent anger by any expreſſion of words. And yet with all this, His vertue was not accompanied with fortune, becauſe he neither ſatisfied thoſe of his owne ſide, nor the Generall with whom he was united, nor yet the Cardinall Protector. Thoſe of his part in the faction that carried themſelves with more affection then prudence, accuſed him of coldneſſe, and that he behav'd himſelfe, as if it concern'd him not to the quick (as who ſhould ſay) that their levity ſhould diſturbe the quietneſſe of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98082:37"/>minde which was ſo well compoſed, and ſo much Superior to their deſtructions. The Generall who was ardent in his nature, whenſoever any new dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie or controverſie was ſet on foote, uſed to make himſelfe merry with it, and was wont to ſay. <hi>Mi chiamovo al mio givoco.</hi> Now they call me to mine owne game. But he could have wiſht that the father had not ſtood ſo much upon the ſole defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive part, obſerving the advantages of the time, and ever throwing out words that tended to pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſetling the commotion. They would have had him purſue all routs, and engage himſelfe into every cauſe by vehement affections, and by reſenting effects. But the Cardinall, who was ſecure that the Generalls overthrow would be the victory of his cauſe, attributed all the directions and managings to proceede from the fathers counſels, which his owne buſineſſe would not give him leave to traverſe.</p>
            <p>This diſſention continued till the yeare 1597, at which time though it were not quencht, yet it had ſome abatement, wherein the father alone obtayn'd his end, though not entirely what he aymed at; concerning the pacification of his province, but by a diverſion or ſport of divine providence (which is no leſſe active in things that we valew leaſt, then in the greateſt) there appeared demonſtration of the vanity of humane deſignes, and therefore to that purpoſe, this digreſſion of ours may not ſeeme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.</p>
            <p>A Fryer, one <hi>Giovanni Battiſta, perugino</hi> who was ſurnamed <hi>Il Lagrimino</hi> (whether it were becauſe he had teares at command) but being a mixt and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man (and flying from the puniſhment which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98082:38"/>the Generall was ready to inflict upon him for ſome delinquencies) came to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the largneſſe of that Citty, and the commodities of concealment make many of that ſort bold to make their refuge. But this fellow had no neede to hide himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very flying from the Generall was enough to bid him welcome to the Provinciall, which was maſter <hi>Gabriel.</hi> But to get a living and ſubſiſtance he procured a licence from the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and begun to play the exorciſt, as I have ſeene many of that run-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way race (who not able to live in obedience) would give a leape into ſuch a compendious way of life, to enjoy their pleaſure, and ſuddenly to raiſe a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fortune. (Becauſe though it be certaine that ſometimes God permits to come upon humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the vexations of evill ſpirits: yet it ſtands as conſonant to reaſon, and to the harmony of our faith, that he does it but ſeldome, and upon very great cauſes.) But when thoſe exorciſts come upon the <hi>Piarras,</hi> they are preſently filled with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and violent motions of the matricall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, nay that all the infirmities which they have contracted, either from a licentious life, or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with their husbands, that they proceede either from ill encounters or of witchcraft. And of the other ſide the exorciſts faile not to play their pranks, who having given a bleſſing to their violent medicaments, and by ſleight of hand made ſome pretty ſhew of art, cauſe their patients to throw out of their ſtomacks, that which never came there, nor could be contained therein. But it is a pretty obſervation, that to heale the greateſt part of theſe diſeaſes, the true remedy is contrary to all other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98082:38"/>cures, which is to drive away their Phyſitians, whereas upon the appearance of any of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebancke Phyſitians, there comes abroad a world of conceald &amp; unknowne infirmities, which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ever underſtood. Our <hi>Lagrimino</hi> among other of his undertakings, had the cure of a trades mans wife at the ſigne of the cocke, in the Mercery, whoſe name was <hi>Deffendi.</hi> And as it happens very often, that practiſe is prolonged beyond hope or expectation. The Fryer beſides his exorciſmes in the Church, came often home to her houſe to viſit her, &amp; the dance was not quite done before the husband began to take notice that many things in his ſhop were miſſing, as ſuch a quantity of Satten, and ſome other ſtuffe of valew; that he was almoſt ready to turne banckrupt. Hereupon he cauſed his apprentice to be arreſted, who being examined confeſſed, That the Frier with his wives knowledge had carried them out of the houſe, and upon further examination, confeſt, that a great part was conveyed to Maſter <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and no ſmall part to the Court of the Popes <hi>Nuncio.</hi> So the myſtery was unfolded, although the Generall had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe to be believed.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Lagrimino</hi> was an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and fit to be impriſoned, for neither the Provinciall, nor the <hi>Nuncio</hi> would heare him, but cried him downe, for a perſequtour. The trades man (that ſtill lives) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering no further but that he was a Frier of the <hi>Servi,</hi> made his complaint to ſome other of that Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, telling them the buſineſſe, which after was ſo managed, that a coppie of the proceſſe was taken forth, and ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Generall, where it happened at the ſame time that maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98082:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſent. The Generall carried the cauſe, and the proceſſe before the Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the knavery, and ignorant how much favour <hi>Gabriel</hi> had then at Court without any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration committed him to priſon. I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in his life time the <hi>Cardinal Sancta Severina</hi> ever ſhewed himſelfe to be a man, nor diſcovered ſo much paſſion, and weakneſſe; (for great ones are but men and ſubject to the ſame paſſions with thoſe of the loweſt people) He ſtampt, he cryed, he curſt, he walkt betweene the Pope and the Governour, and for all he could doe, he could not enlarge the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for many daies after. Becauſe <hi>Lagrimino</hi> that was gone into <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria</hi> had beene impriſoned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and being confronted, had ſuſtained the things mentioned. And though after he were made recant by charging it upon the Generall, and ſo ſet free, yet nevertheleſſe he diſappear'd and vaniſht out of the world (though not like <hi>Enoch</hi>) By this time the Cardinall ſaw that it was not poſſible to create maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> his Generall at a chapter that was then called at <hi>Rome,</hi> but yet he was able to put him that was Generall under judgment, and to that purpoſe kept him in the priſon of <hi>Santa Maria in via</hi> &amp; particularly becauſe <hi>Lagrimino</hi> had accuſed him, to be ſuborned; and by the Cardinalls order there were committed many exorbitances and violences in the order under certaine pretences, both with cauſe and without cauſe employing the officers of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo far, that except to thoſe that had ſeene them the things were beyond beliefe.</p>
            <p>During theſe paſſages, there being a provinciall chapter at <hi>Venice</hi> to be celebrated in <hi>Vicenza,</hi> he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98082:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>created preſident by a writ from the Pope, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that Citty <hi>Michel Priuli</hi> a man of great ſence and prudence, who perceiving of one ſide the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Fryars, and on the other ſide the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> commands, knew not which ſide he ſhould adhere to; And ſeeing the ſpirits of the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inflamed, he was perſwaded by thoſe of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls</hi> faction to conſent to an innovation, which was never tryed before, and that was to move the Rectors to admit ſome ſergeants and other officers into the Monaſtery to prevent diſorder, but really intended to intimidate (if not uſe violence) upon the other partie. But this made things worſe, then formerly before, making the parties more obſtinate. And prolonging the Chapter to eight daies length, which had wont to be determined in a few houres. And theſe ſerjeants ſeeing all things ſetled in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and about eight Friers without armes (ſo much as their knives,) they laid downe their gunns, and left their armes careleſly upon certaine tables, that ſtood in the Cloiſters, and the ſouldiers without further thought of any thing either ſtood ſtill, or went into the cellars to drinke, or into the ſtorehouſe, or forth into the Mount to ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In the meane time the Friers fretted, and knaw'd the chaine to ſee ſuch a company of idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes without any imployment, a thing never done before, and ſo ſcandalous to religion, to ſee them conſume thoſe proviſions which ought to be the aliment of the convent. And their ſpirits were the more imbittered by the provoking language of thoſe that gave it out that they that did not render themſelves ſhortly to the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> order, ſhould
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98082:40"/>either be throwne in priſon, or ſent to the gallies, or be otherwiſe diſpoſed of like dogges. And the laſt ſtroke which was like to end the buſineſſe was, that one evening there came from <hi>Vicenza</hi> to this Monaſtery of the mount (where the Chapter ſate) the Biſhop with another briefe from his holineſſe (beſides that of his Preſidentſhip) which was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Vicenza</hi> in leſſe then fortie houres, giving order that the preſident might have power to expell the Generall vicar out of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beſide a moſt ample authority to ſuſpend, transfer or prolong the Chapter, and whatſoever he ſhould thinke fit. Whereat ſome of the wiſer ſort rather laught, then wondred, to ſee that in a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular action being a thing of ſo ſmall moment, there ſhould be ſent forth two apoſtolicall briefes. And the Pope himſelfe enter into the Comedy after ſo great a Cardinall with the authoritie of the two <hi>Saints Sanctorum Petri &amp; Pauli,</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the adage <hi>Magno conatu nugas agere.</hi> That faction to which ſo much favour was expreſt, was added into the Biſhops traine, entring into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery in a tumultuous way, with much noiſe, and to ſolemnize their triumph the more, they cauſed to be carried two naked ſwords before them, with certaine acclamations which had beene more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for plebeians, then religious men. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſo great an alteration, that immediately a crue of young fellowes brought that very night (the dore being ſet open) into the Fryers cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with great ſilence, a number of thoſe brave <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centines</hi> with whom they had intelligence, and were reſolved the next morning when the Biſhop
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98082:40"/>and the chapter were met (which was alwaies in the refectory) and ſerjeants having left their guns careleſsly (as they uſed to doe) to fall upon them, and take ſuch a revenge as their anger, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſuch injuries ſhould ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>Yet they lingred a while till they could ſpeake with one that might give notice of their deſigne to <hi>Padre Paulo.</hi> But it is a very hard matter that a thing knowne to ſo many, ſhould be conceal'd; wherefore he among others having had an inckling of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, it is moſt certaine that with much labour and waking a great part of the night, by entreating ſome, and commanding others, and giving a cleare underſtanding to all, of the danger they ſhould bring upon themſelves, of the ſlight conſequence of the things in queſtion, and the ſcandall that might ariſe. But above any thing elſe the venerall eſteeme that they had of his authority was potent meanes to ſuppreſſe the conſpiracy. Yet he ſaw well that it was a matter of neceſſity to put an end to thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which were no longer to be contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the confines of voting, but would be ſure to riſe into higher termes. And becauſe that being once admitted for a preſident, and ſo horrid a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſetled, it would be an incouragement to others to attempt the like. There is not in matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a more ſecure reſtraint then to know what mighty miſchiefes are poſſible to enſue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the father was reſolv'd to doe his uttermoſt endeavour to compoſe the diviſions which he could not doe ſo well, as by making a journey in perſon to <hi>Rome.</hi> But the matter of the aforeſaid letter in Cypher, and that of his communication with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98082:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>was a great diſcouragement to his going. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (although he might well diſcerne an inſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, &amp; that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> Protector was not much incens't by any inſtances againſt him upon thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations; although he ſent other cauſes of very light valew, to the Inquiſitors againſt Fryers and others (&amp; as ſoone againe took them off, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of voting in the Chapter houſe was paſt) which for the moſt part was one of the chiefe ends of thoſe practiſes of his, nevertheleſſe, the father tooke into conſideration, what the diſpleaſure of ſo great a man might doe, that had the power of judgment in his hands, as <hi>Santa Severina</hi> (being head of the Congegation of the holy office) had. And that in <hi>Rome</hi> it was well knowne how neare he was after <hi>Clement</hi> in election to the Papacy, and the queſtion was not onely extinct, whether that election of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were valid or not. Wherefore <hi>Clement</hi> was willing to feed the <hi>Cardinals</hi> humour by giving him leave to doe what he lifted, beſides that he was truly a great perſonage, and very active, and able to bring any buſineſſe to what end he pleas'd, as it is an eafie matter for great men to ſerve themſelves upon any pretence, to juſtifie every thing after it is done. So he conſulted with his intimate friends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point, whoſe opinion was, that he could receive no great damage, eſpecially, ſince by a great number of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> letters which are yet in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and I have ſeene them when I intended to make this life like an epiſtolary hiſtory, and to have prduced the letters for a confirmation of what I had written, if the length and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98082:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>had not diſſwaded me) it appeard, that he had a great opinion of the fathers integrity, and prudence, and that he had deſired to ſee him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have intereſſed him in that Court. But the father facetiouſly remembred the fable how the prudent Fox, when the Lyon made proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all horned beaſts to come in) hid himſelfe ſaying, what if the lyon would have his eares to be hornes, who ſhould be able to defend him? yet notwithſtanding he was reſolved to goe. But as it was his manner to be as confident in the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as if ſecond cauſes had not beene conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; yet omitting no fit meanes where ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be the producers of their effects; And firſt of all he got good letters from his friends to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Venice</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to divers great Prelates at Court; Then by letters he made knowne the whole buſineſſe, to the Cardinall of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> (for he was likewiſe of the congregation of the holy office) with whom he had alwaies continued his ſervitude by a commerce of letters, and from him he was adviſed to come. At <hi>Rome</hi> there was a generall Chapter celebrated, wherein the Cardinall not being able to make maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: he called from <hi>Florence</hi> a father that had beene fifteene yeares ſhut up in his chamber in a holy life, but yet with him neither, he was not very well pleaſed, be cauſe whether for zeale of conſcience, or for any other reſpect, I know not, but he alſo extreamely abhor'd to conſent that <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſhould ſucceed him: and loved and honored the father as much as was poſſible, (although againſt the orders which he ſaid, had beene given him,) and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98082:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in a very high degree, by writing him a very long letter, in an apologetique way, blaming him for all his miſchiefes that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in religion, and for uſing ſuch violent waies to make a wicked wretch his Generall; touching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect, upon the briberies and guifts that were brought to his Court, by the ſale of al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and graces, and by the pillage and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of Convents. But that which cut him to the quicke, was, that he affirmed that he had written unto him not onely after a long conſideration; but with particular inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>At the reading whereof the Cardinall broke out into paſſion and cried out, <hi>Tu menti ſantarieto Caca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienda,</hi> for he had alwayes kept a tang of the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Dialect. But this poore Generall was called to <hi>Rome</hi> where in a very ſhort time he ended his life. It was ſaid to be of a heate which he gave himſelfe by walking about the ſeaven Churches, and there are ſome that ſaid it was by ſome coſt that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him. But his death gave a great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to all religion, becauſe (as tis already ſaid) he had lived fifteene yeares ſhut up in his cell at a holy life, where by pontificall indulgence he celebrated the maſſe, and every wedneſday expounded upon his altar the holy ſacrament, before which he continued praying til the friday following without taſting any foode, and his diet was alwaies lenten fare, and for the moſt part bread and fruite and water. In which life he continued for matter of abſtinence after his coming to his charge, &amp; he was eſteemed <hi>a Santo;</hi> and as of ſuch a one is his life written and printed. His very enemies reported him to be a man of holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98082:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>though not ſo able for government. But the blame which fell upon the <hi>Cardinall</hi> for putting him under cenſure cannot be expreſt.</p>
            <p>The father treated with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and ſought alwaies to pleaſe him, becauſe, that being done all other things were determined. And it fell out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well for him, becauſe they had no ſpeech of any other matter, but onely theſe two. The one that he had adhaered to, and fomented the late tumults, or rather ſtir'd up the Generall, the other, that he would not be friends with Maſter <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which he anſwered, that he would remit the whole buſineſſe to his Lordſhip, &amp; was deſired to be reconcil'd to him: To the particulars he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered more at length. That by his Lordſhips pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and favour he had ſeene Maſter <hi>Laeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> made Proct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Generall; and after that vicar generall Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, and ſubſequently Generall, and that he had deſired the friendſhip of <hi>Laelio</hi> as of one of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips creatures, and had correſponded with him in all things which he thought might concerne the ſervice of God and religion. And that it was his dutie to honor that man whom he ſaw raiſed above others, without any curious inveſtigations of the reaſons why it was done. That if things grew after to be changed, he conceived that to be an accident of a fortune. And thereupon he put him in minde of letter, which when <hi>Laelio</hi> was created Generall his Lordſhip had written with his owne hand, whereby he recommended him unto him, that by his vote, and the votes of friends he might be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before any other of his concurrents, ſo that he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98082:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>could not interpret ſuch a recommendation for leſſe then a command. For of ſuch a nature he ſaid were the requeſts of perſons that were eminent. And as to that of having ſtirred up the Generall, his eminency having by his publique letters to all the Religion (directed to the Chapters of Provinces) made great complaint of the impetuous and violent nature of <hi>Lelio,</hi> he was ſure his Lordſhip had not that conceipt againſt him of himſelfe, but by the ſuggeſtion and falſe relation of ſome others, whereto hee would at all times be ready to make anſwer in his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, onely referr'd it to his prudence which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to penetrate that and greater matters, nor was it like, that ſeeing a coach runne ſwiftly by, he would make it a doubt, whether the coach drew the horſes, or they it. He inſinuated moreover that foure yeares before that 1593 in the vacancy of the Biſhopricke of <hi>Milopotamo,</hi> his Lordſhip had begg'd it for him of his Holineſſe, and in a letter written to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and exhorting him to diſpoſe himſelfe to receive it, when it ſhould be conferred upon him; He added that in a ſecond place he had named him to another in event of his not accepting that, becauſe he was not ſure of his intentions being ſo retired a man, and alienate from every thing elſe but a totall immerſion in his ſtudies, and a lover of a quiet life. All which letters he had kept together, as the titles of his obligation to his illuſtrious Lordſhip. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Cardinall gave great teſtimony of good ſatisfaction, and replied; that truly having taken notice of his deportments, hee beleeved no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and told him further that he would have him and Maſter <hi>Gabriel</hi> made friends, as alſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors power it was effected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98082:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He returned to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> to his beloved retiredneſſe, and not without ſome grievance of his naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition imbittered by his voyage and other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. And though there might continue with him (as we uſe to ſay) a little of the old ſea of his turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fortunes, yet he moderated them all with an incomparable patience and prudence. And it ſeemed that for a few yeares after his infirmities made their peace with him, which the ſpace of 25 yeares before had yeelded him but ſhort and uncertaine truces of his <hi>Epaticke flux,</hi> he remained cured, without any other cauſe, but that it had ſpent the Courſe. Hee had from time to time uſed divers remedies aſwell by the great knowledge which he had in medicine, as alſo by the opinions of the moſt conſpicuous and famous Phyſitians, with whom he had great famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity both in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> and <hi>Padua,</hi> and for the falling of the ſtraight gutt (which in time and with increaſe of age might render him unable for any action, and fixe him if not to his bed at leaſt to his chamber,) He had continually proved many remedies without profit; after he gave himſelfe to ſeeke out ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to keepe it up, and having tried many, he found one at laſt ſo proper and fit, that with it alone he was able to carry his diſeaſe to the laſt day of his life without hindrance from any action, more then if he had not had the diſeaſe, and it is of ſo eaſie and ready a uſe, that having imparted it to others, it hath had the ſame effect with them, by keeping them in ability of motion and action; without which they muſt have remained in great paine and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This quietneſſe continued about ſixe yeares more, his life being all the while imployed in divine
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98082:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>office, (wherin as twas ſaid) he ſpent all his time, and in the converſation of <hi>virtuoſos</hi> without the leaſt hindrance.</p>
            <p>From ſome notes that were found and are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, it appeares about that time that hee chang'd the quality of his ſtudies, and gave himſelfe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (beſides the Eccleſiaſticall and prophane ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) to the ſtudie of Morall Philoſophie, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that which is written of <hi>Socrates,</hi> is no ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act, or rather voluntary, but is as it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all thoſe underſtandings that have any thing oftranſcendent, who after they have made a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very at what they can arrive upon univerſalities, they tranſport themſelves totally to morality;) which ſtudie (as to inferiour things) is the onely ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humanity. This ariſeth either from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire made more intenſe to better it ſelfe, or from ſome <hi>incomprehenſibilitie</hi> that is met with; or from a ſolid judgement of the vanitie even of Sciences, and of the excellencies of vertue, or the ſingularitie of that part of Metaphyſick, whoſe object is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the meanes thereof, and of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that either are internall or from others.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certaine that Father <hi>Paul</hi> applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſuch kinde of ſtudies, having before that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined all the workes of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and of <hi>Plato,</hi> with little notes of his owne extant from one part to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother upon the one, and from Dialogue to Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue on the other, but ſo ſhort, and for the moſt part writing onely the firſt letter of a word, that one may eaſily perceive that either he wrote to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone for rememoratives, or elſe that in his age he deſigned matter from ſome further worke. But
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98082:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>I doe rather beleeve the firſt, becauſe he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelfe a yeares life, as hee would alwaies conſtantly affirme.</p>
            <p>He had examined the Doctrine of all the antient Philoſophers of all ſorts, ſo farre as there remaines any mention or memory diſperſt among writers, and given his judgement upon them. Hee had alſo examined the opinions of Schoolemen aſwell of the reall as the nominall, which he made much account of, as appeares by ſome other ſhort notes of his. The Mathematiques of all ſorts, the medicinall, the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomicall, the ſimples, the minerals, the mechaniques and of all the qualities, upon which his notes (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) yet remaine, whereof that little that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible is verypretious, and ſhewes what rules were hidden in the Mine of that rare underſtanding. There are yet letters of ſome very learned men of his time, wherein it appeares that they ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his opinion in ſome of the moſt arduous things of Sciences, and particularly of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, and when any of them had either obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or invented any new or ſtrange thing, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſought to have his judgement upon it. Oh the great loſſe, that we cannot ſee his anſwers. I have ſeene a certaine diſcourſe which was ſent him from one <hi>Marioti,</hi> who in many chapters treates of the ebbing and flowing, which it ſeemes the father approved not of, by a coppie of a letter of his owne wherein he tells him, that he ſends him what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and had obſerved about the motion of the waters. I deplore the loſſe of his letters, and the misfortune of men therein, that from time to time there ſhould be any loſſe of that which hath beene
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98082:45"/>found out by great witts. What a misfortune is it to us that in Hiſtory it ſhould bee neceſſary to begin from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and all that was before to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fables and confuſion. (In this account we ranck not the ſacred ſtory of the Bible which was Gods guift, and no humane induſtry.) In Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Geographie to begin from <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in the Mathematiques from <hi>Euclide,</hi> and all the remainder (that is) the worke of ſo rare and excellent ſpirits whoſe names are ſcarce in memory, ſhould be peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The loſſe of what the father wrote concerning the moving of the waters, drawes from my pen the deploration of a misfortune which I perſwade my ſelfe if it had beene extant, had beene like foode to the mindes of ſo great underſtandings, which have beene famiſh't without ſo much as hope of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring any thing that might at leaſt in appeareance give fat is faction upon that ſubject.</p>
            <p>But in thoſe following yeares whereof we ſpeake, He ſeemed to be wholy engaged to that ſort of ſtudy which is onely verſt in weeding out the vices of the minde, and planting and cultivating it with vertues. And upon this ſubject he hath written ſo many little treatiſes, which he uſed to carry about him with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and documents aſwell of the moſt ancient celebrated writers, as of his owne, that if ever they came to light it will ſhew a collection of precious jewels of ineſtimable value. Three things I have only ſeene, elaborate after the manner of <hi>Plutarkes</hi> little works. On the medicine of the minde, wherein applying the Aphoriſmes which are written for the health and cure of the body to the cure and ſanity of the minde which he limits (as it ſeemes) to maladies
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98082:45"/>that are only in ſtate and not in motion, or in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from paine (whereat a man in this life can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive) onely he directs many ſingular meanes to obtaine a tranquillity. Another little treatiſe of the riſing and ceaſing of opinions in us. And the laſt that Atheiſme is repugnant to humane nature, and is not found therein, but that they which acknowledge not a true Deity, muſt neceſſarily faine themſelves falſe ones. There alſo two little bookes which goe together like a Metaphyſick, but imperfect and full of new and abſtruſe ſences. There is alſo a ſhort examen of his owne defects whereunto hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a cure, and this was fit to fal into the hands of thoſe who after his death like doggs that draw dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot have not left the leaſt by-way untraced to finde out ſome odours of imperfection: and here they might have ſeene a man that never flatter'd himſelfe, but made a reall ſcurtiny unto the moſt recluded corners of his owne heart, and both ſaw, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in himſelfe thoſe things which to every other eye had beene inviſible. And thoſe that in the reſt of his life for more then 20. yeares had lived inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately with him doe moſt holily atteſt, that they were never able to obſerve any ſuch defects in him. Becauſe peradventure in thoſe ſixe yeares of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtudies, hee had regulated himſelfe like thoſe true poſſeſſors of wiſedome, who ſtudie not ſo much to ſeeme learned as to be truely and really good.</p>
            <p>But all this was nothing, compar'd to his beeing affixt to the divine Scripture, particularly of the new Teſtament, without any expofitor except onely the Greeke and Latine texts which hee uſed toreade from one end to the other, repeating it over ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98082:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>times that hee had it all in memory, and upon occaſion was able to repeate it all in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as by daily frequency religious men uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the ordinary Pſalmes. His attention was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and profound, that as in reading hee obſerved any point for meditation, hee made in his Greeke teſtament upon the word or verſe a little line after this manner — And ſo by reading it over againe there was ſcarce a line or almoſt a word which had not a marke upon it, whereof a great Prince having heard after his death, did for curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities deſire to ſee the booke, wee have alſo ſeene the very ſame courſe formerly uſed upon the old Teſtament, as alſo his breviary wherein he recited the office markt all (as aforeſaid) but eſpecially upon the pſalmes which he knew all by heart, as alſo whatſoever was to be ſaid in celebration of the maſs, whereof this is a ſufficient demonſtration that in his laſt yeares he could not ſee, nor reade any word that was either written or printed without his ſpectacles, and yet without them he did alwaies uſe to celebrate the maſſe.</p>
            <p>I could not learne whether in theſe ſix years he had borrowed from his aſſiduity &amp; immerſion in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies more then two deviations. The one was that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onardo Mocenigo</hi> being created Biſhop of <hi>Caveda,</hi> who was one of thoſe that many times (though not ſo often as others) frequented that glorius meeting of ſo many famous perſonages (the rendezvous of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſini</hi>) was deſirous firſt to be inſtructed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the profeſſion Canonicall, and in whatſoever elſe (beſides his owne learning) was convenient for his new Epiſcopall calling, and afterwards
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98082:46"/>to have his company along with him to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where the Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight was then abiding, and where he was to be examined and conſecrated. The other was that famous controverſie which (by the power of the Dominican and Jeſuiticall facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) remaines ſtill undecided. Of the efficacy of divine grace called <hi>de auxiliis,</hi> whereof there hath beene ſo much ſaid, and ſo much written. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of which difference, The Biſhop of <hi>Montepeloſo</hi> who was before that his intrinſecall friend by the name of <hi>Maeſtro Hippolito da Lucca,</hi> a a man of much ſcholaſticall learning, but of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fame for goodneſſe. This man had read Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie many yeares in the ſtudy &amp; univerſity of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and was alſo confeſſor to <hi>Madame</hi> the Dutcheſſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and a very confident ſervant of hers, when <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> died. That <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was in an ill repute with many of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, that ſhe had beene unfaithfull in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of ſome advantage to <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Eſte.</hi> And this father himſelfe either for truth or for ſome neare reſpect of ſervice to the Princeſſe, was alſo in a fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter fame, to have either in confeſſion, or ſome other diſcourſe (being himſelfe corrupted) by large promiſes, and great hopes, perſwaded the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe to adhaere to the Ecleſiaſticall faction. So it is; that he had (not long after) a ſlight recompence from Cardinall <hi>Aldobrandine</hi> of the ſaid ſmall Biſhopricke in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> but he was alwaies entertayned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and deputed for one of thoſe Prelates to examine the ſaid controverſie. And he, to whom the fathers great learning was ſo well knowne, procured by letters, and by his utmoſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98082:47"/>power to make him come to <hi>Rome</hi> with large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. After ſeeing him reſolute not to open his mouth in thoſe windie and ſwolne differences, went about to induce him by friendſhip to review the matter, and by letters communicated his ſence to him. But this imployment was not worth the name of a deviation, he having formerly moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly read and ſtudied all the ancient fathers, and had in them a ſingular practiſe, but eſpecially in <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> in whom the doctrine of that point is more fully handled then in all the reſt (And it may truly be ſaid, that the two tomes, the ſixt and ſeaventh beſides the tenth have no other ſcope) and thoſe were ſo familiar to him, that a place could not be ſooner toucht, but his hand was as ready to be laid upon it, and in hearing it alledged, was able to ſay whether it were faithfully reported, and was able to recite both the antecedent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words. In all his writings there was nothing found of his in memory of that buſineſſe, but onely ſome reſponfive letters of the ſaid Biſhops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeared the father had written oft unto him of that buſineſſe, and of things whereby the prelate receiving a great deale of honor, did alwaies move and urge the fathers coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> but in vaine. He was, as it could be gathered out of thoſe letters, of the opinion of <hi>Saint Thomas,</hi> to which he added the names of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> againſt the ancient and moderne Pelagians and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mipelagians. There is onely extant a ſhort writing to this purpoſe, in which it appeares that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Prince he had explicated the ſtate of that controverſie in <hi>Italian,</hi> and what were the opinions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98082:47"/>of the controverſies with their explications and principall foundation. A ſhort worke but which it ſhewes the lucidneſſe of that minde and his felicity in explicating the moſt arduous things.</p>
            <p>At the end of the ſaid ſix yeares, or not long after, there were two occaſions out of which (it was believed) there ſprung another diſturbance; becauſe upon the death of the Generall, which was maſter <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who was created 1603 (being fifteene yeares later then the foundation of the deſigne of that creation was at firſt laid) there was ſupplyed to that government a nephew of his by the name of <hi>Maeſtro Santo</hi> with onely the bare title of <hi>Definitor,</hi> who having his uncles hopes, though not his power, and eſpecially failing in that aptitude of his to ſerve the Court at all aſſaies (which the General was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies wont to do: to whom after his death therewere letters found that Cardinall <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> had writ with his owne hand, and <hi>Borgheſe</hi> both nephewes to Popes, wherein it was ſeene that at <hi>Venice</hi> he had beene a ſervant to the Court) in things that might either have coſt him his life, or elſe advanc't him to a greater Prelacy. <hi>Maeſtro Santo</hi> imitated his uncle in this opinion, that if he would domineere over the province, it was neceſſary to remove that mote out of his eye, which was the veneration and honor wherewith the father was followed. And to this purpoſe he attempted many exorbitant things, among which there was one that was moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. It is a cuſtome when Chapters are called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that thoſe that have votes make a ſcrutiny among themſelves to legitimate their Capitular actions. And that it might be without exception
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98082:48"/>every one reſerves himſelfe a fredome to queſtion or oppoſe whom or whatſoever he thinke good. So <hi>Maeſtro Santo,</hi> and <hi>Maeſtro Arcangelo</hi> ſtood up, and to doe nothing with much diligence, and with power to make a conſpicuous buffonery; they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd three heads of exception or reproach againſt father <hi>Paul,</hi> with the indignation and deriſion of all the Chapter, and they were theſe. That he wore a hat upon his head contrarie to a forme that had beene lately publiſhed under <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth. That he wore pantables that were hollowed in the ſoles of the <hi>French</hi> faſhion (alledging falſly) that it had beene decreed otherwiſe upon paine of depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their votes. That at the end of Maſſe he did not uſe to repeate the <hi>Salve Regina.</hi> Things that were no ſooner heard then reſolved by the Vicar ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the Preſident and the Provinciall into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and exploded by all the aſſembly, being rejected and kickt out. And becauſe his pantobles were taken off by order from the Judge, and caried to the Tribunall, it became a proverbe which is yet in uſe. <hi>Eſſer il Padre Paolo coſi incolpabile &amp; integro ebe ſivio le ſue pianiſſe erano ſtate canonizate.</hi> The father <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo blameles and pure that his very pantobler were canoniz'd. That his not reciting the <hi>Salve Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina</hi> aroſe not out of any indevotion.</p>
            <p>It would be too long to deliver the ground or reaſon inducing him not to doe it. True it is that he had reaſons ſo well grounded, that it was more lawfully omitted by him at that time, then it was added by others, againſt the rights of the maſſe, and derogating by a particular decree of about 30 Friers from the univerſall order of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98082:48"/>
It was obſerved that in all that action of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, examining and exploding thoſe exceptions, he never ſpake word, nor ſhew'd the leaſt ſigne of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with it: but went on upon occaſion of diſcourſe, and as he had uſed to doe with thoſe his accuſers, and in ſpecie with <hi>Maeſtro Santo,</hi> who had forgotten his uncles documents, which at his death he left with him; (viz.) That he ſhould never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any great thing in the province without the opinion of father <hi>Paul.</hi> So not taking counſell where he ſhould have done, and being too confident of his uncles merits with the Court, and laſtly puft up with vaine hopes from a certaine Abbot, who was an impoſtor, (and is yet living) who ſold him thoſe hopes at the price of a good ſilver goblet, He truſt up his baggage, and carried with him to <hi>Rome</hi> whatſoever he could get, being about five hundred duckats which belong'd to the Monaſtery which he there ſpent in foure monthes; And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he went thither full of great hopes, he returned againe ful of maltalent, and deſperation, which ſent him into <hi>Candy</hi> to raiſe a fortune in merchandiſe, where not long after he left his life, having firſt loſt and ſpent what he had.</p>
            <p>By this time (wee may ſay) that the fathers quiet ſtudies and his private life were come to their period, and that from hence till the end of his life, he entred upon another world; or rather came into the world, wherein it pleaſed God to call him into employments, which he had never thought he ſhould have applied himſelfe to.</p>
            <p>But man is not borne alone for himſelfe, but principally for his Countrey and for a common
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98082:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>good. That probleme whether a wiſe man ought to apply himſelfe to government? let others diſpute. This father of ours ſhall give us an example to refuſe no paines nor peril for the ſervice of God; and of his Countrey. And that an honeſt and wiſe man is far from that erroneous doctrine, invented by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſeditious coſeners, who never ſpeake of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular policy but with diſparagement, although it were inſtituted of God, and in which an honeſt man may ſerve his divine majeſtie with a vocation as pious, as excellent, and that no other employment can either exceede it or match it, as well for the common good, as in obedience to that ſupreme piety which may be exerciſed in the Church, and whereunto God from time to time, and ſince the very birth of the Church, hath called even the greateſt Heroes of all the eccleſiaſticall order.</p>
            <p>At this time was aſſum'd to the Pontificate, the Cardinall <hi>Camillo Borgheſe</hi> of <hi>Sienna, Paul</hi> the fifth, about the end of the yeare 1605. either becauſe he had beene Auditor <hi>della Camera,</hi> and had taken a great habite of thundering out cenſures, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being not well affected to the moſt ſevere Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> or elſe inſtigated by ſome religious men (as I have it more certaine and by cleerer arguments) who like vipers teare in pieces, and poyſon that breſt of ſtate that gave them bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and nouriſhment; the pretence of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence being grounded upon ſome lawes of that common-wealth which were ſaid to be againſt church priviledges. So that things fell into a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diſſention among them: the Pope pretending that thoſe lawes were not onely unjuſt but cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98082:49"/>and aboliſh't; on the contrary ſide the Repub lique maintained that they were juſt, and good lawes, and in no interpretation contrary to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberties of the Church.</p>
            <p>This buſineſſe boyling betwixt thoſe two great princes, ſome of the primary Senators, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beene the fathers familiars, began to confer ſtrictly with him about this controverſie, for it could not be concealed; not onely in <hi>Venice</hi> (a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which for amplitude and concourſe of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons knowes all things and ſilenceth nothing,) but alſo over all <hi>Italy,</hi> and upon his arguments which were confirm'd by a precedent knowledge they had of him, they proceeded to acquainte him with the buſineſſe by a pulicke communication.</p>
            <p>This fire lay long raked up under aſhes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and anſwers, and arguments on both ſides, by the ſpace of a month, when about the entrance of the yeare 1606. it threw forth greater flames of monitories &amp; comminations of cenſures. Becauſe the matter being partly Thelogicall and partly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, the moſt excellent Senate came to a reſolution, to choſe next after their conſultors in Jure, a man that was both a divine and a Canoniſt. And after having cauſed to be read a ſhort writing to that purpoſe, they made choice of the father into that charge, who hath ſince ſerved them ſeaventeene yeares, not onely in that facultie, but as a conſultor of ſtate in all their charges of greateſt conſequence. Becauſe though his hands (as it is ſaid) are paſt all ſort of matters of peace, of warre, of their confines, of their covenants, of juriſdiction, of tribute, and of every other ſort of treaties. But this alone may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98082:50"/>make it knowne how univerſall, how faithfull, and ſincere his ſervice was, that upon the death of the conſultors in law (men of eternall memory) <hi>Marc. Antonio Pelegrini, Eraſme Gratiani, Agoſtno del bene</hi>) the common-wealth was ſo well ſerved by the father alone in all ſort of buſineſſe, that they choſe no ſucceſſors into their places, as was formerly uſed to be done, except it were one <hi>Il Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Servilco Tree,</hi> and when he failed by death, the father remained alone.</p>
            <p>Being now entred upon this charge, he thought it of neceſſity to have companions of experimented fidelitie, whom he might truſt as himſelfe, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to turne over books for him. Becauſe the cuſtomes of thoſe times thought it not enough, to know things with reſolutions, and reaſons, but they would have an addition of a long ſeries of Allegations of Doctors of the one, and the other law. And he that would not erre upon the credit of others, which often deceives men, thought it was neceſſary for him from point to point to ſee the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors at the fountaine, being a buſineſſe rather of much toile then wit.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe he caſt his thoughts upon <hi>Frier Fulgentio</hi> a Breſcian (to whom he had long before vouchſaf' the favour of a ſtrict familiaritie) making uſe of him for ordinary ſtudying, and being ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, not by way of ordinary readings, which he eſteemed to be rather a way of oſtentation, then any waies fruitfull, but after the manner of Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and in a midwife-like way appointing to reade ſuch bookes, or ſuch a matter, and then after by diſcourſe to finde out and produce the truth, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98082:50"/>ſhew the errors and ſo ſettle a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. A meanes truly both ſingular and excellent, to teach a man the way to be wiſe, although it have beene neglected and out of uſe, to prevent, as they ſay, a ſhew of pompe and oſtentation.</p>
            <p>The reader will be pleas'd to diſpence with this little digreſſion in this place, becauſe it ſerves to take away an objection made againſt the fathers goodneſſe, not onely by the Friers, but by ſome of his owne intimate friends, that he being ſo rare a man in all learning ſhould be ſo ſparing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his knowledge to others. And many have gone ſo far as to tax him of an envious diſpoſition, that he tooke no pleaſure in another mans wiſdome, and loved rather to hide thoſe rich talents of his owne from others. But really it was not ſo, for he was rather of the moſt friendly and bountifull ſoule in this particular, that could poſſibly be found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he communicated with an incredible readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whatſoever was required upon occaſion, and with a prudence ſo much to beadmired, (though not to all men) but yet to every one according to their capacity or profeſſion, and in ſuch manner as hath beene already told.</p>
            <p>Here I could put you in minde of Gentlemen and religious men whom he hath made perfect, ſome in the moralls, others in the Mathematiques and in naturalls. But to make a profeſt reading upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle, Plato, Saint Thomas, Scoto</hi> or <hi>Gratian</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the mathematiques) which to be taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order and not to be taught is all one, this was ſo contrary to his Genius, that he could not endure it, and held it a pedantique way, as not ſerving to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98082:51"/>encreaſe knowledg, or better the minde, but onely to be able to argue with ſubtillty, and make a ſhew of wit, and rather to breed a pertinacity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then to make a ſincere ſearch of the truth.</p>
            <p>Returning to our narration, he reſolved to have with him for his compagnion the foreſaid <hi>Fra. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio,</hi> who was at that time in the univerſitie of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> and in the ſixt yeare of his profeſſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſchoole divinty, having read before that three yeares at <hi>Mantova,</hi> and being further engag'd from the Generall of the order to read three yeares longer at <hi>Bologna,</hi> wherein he had made his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But the command of his maſter that required him expreſsly and without exception, alledging that he ſtood in neede of him as far as concern'd his life, made him breake through all obſtacles, and leaving his lecture, and what hope ſoever he might conceive of preferment in religion, and being well aſſured of what followed, which was the confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his poore library and thoſe moveables which were allowed him for his uſe, he came away whither the charitie of his beloved maſter or father invited him.</p>
            <p>After this the controverſie betwixt theſe two great Princes grew higher then any termes of negotiation among themſelves could compaſſe, and before any other Princes could interpoſe as they did after for accommodation: The father with the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulters was continually at the worke and imployed by the publique prudence, ſeeking out how the moſt excellent Senate <hi>(ſalva la ruierenza)</hi> which was due to the Apoſtolicall ſea might governe themſelves, to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98082:51"/>maintaine their liberty and power of a ſoveraigne Prince as independent in their own Dominions. The father made divers informations by publique order which are extant, and chiefely one little tractate concerning excommunication, wherein with as much brevity as a writing that was to be read in ſuch a ſecrecy could import for inſtruction, and wih greater cleareneſſe, all being comprehended that was eſſential to that cenſure, as the inſtisution of it, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate uſe of it in holy church, the manner how Princes &amp; republiques have grounded themſelvs upon like occaſions (although it wil be hard to find ſuch government among Catholique Chriſtians, which at ſome time or other hath not ſuffered by thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the court of <hi>Rome</hi>) (ſince that about the eleventh age from our Lord, that abuſe crept in of employing ſpirituall armes to mundane ends,) all was briefely comprehended in conformity to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, to holy Councells, to the ſacred anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctors, &amp; how in ſuch a ſubject a faithfull pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and catholique Prince ought to deport himſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is a great loſſe, that among other writings of his concerning the publique (which are many great volumes, and of ineſtimable value in all matters of ſtate) this ſhould not be found, and he that kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der key all his life long even to the leaſt bolletines and ſhort notes that he made upon every word that concerned the publique which he had written du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his faithfull ſervice, and having ſearched for this with extraordinary diligence, yet it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be found: but we have a certaine rudiment which ſeemes to have beene the firſt draught of the diſcourſe, which is full of ſolidity and chriſtian pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98082:52"/>Beſides the writings and conſultations whereof we neede to ſay no more but that the moſt excellent Senate, having by publique decree commanded they ſhould be copied out into bookes for future uſe in government. Hee was conſtrained againſt his will, and againſt what he had alwaies propoſed to himſelf to publiſh ſome things that hee had written upon theſe occurents.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it was thought neceſſary to give the world a ſhort account of the ſtate of the controverſie, which from thoſe pens that were devoted to the Romane Court, went ſo maskt and diſguiſed, that the people were extreamly abuſed, as if the controverſie had only concerned religion, whereas there was nothing elſe in the queſtion but of jurisdiction: and ſo at the very beginning there came forth at <hi>Milan</hi> a long writing in print, which was on purpoſe nail'd up in the night, and faſtened in the publique places at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo,</hi> and upon the <hi>Bergamaſco,</hi> (which are lands that in the temporality are ſubject to the ſtate of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi>) and in the ſpiritualty are under the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Millan.</hi>) They contained things of much exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, That their Sacraments could not be valide, that their Matrimonies were concubinates, their children illegitimate, and divers other things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the doctrine of the very Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall law. This engaged a neceſſity of giving the world a ſhort account of the truth.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the father never made profeſſion of any language which he had not well ſtudied, but onely to ſerve to the explication of his owne ſence, he made a collection in writing into certaine heads, of all that he thought fit to be ſpoken of. And it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98082:52"/>was after given in charge to <hi>Gio: Battiſta Leoni</hi> a man that was moſt vers't in the elegancies of the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, having ſpent his time in it, when he was the Secretary of <hi>Cardinall Comendone</hi> and of other Prelates, and had to his honour, put divers things in print which were well approved of. And after he had beene a whole day in the company of <hi>Leoni</hi> to informe him throughly, being continually himſelfe imployed in greater matters, he required <hi>Fra. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio,</hi> that had borne a great part in making that collection, to looke to divers places in the authors themſelves, and to diſcuſſe the matters from pointe to pointe. And before he would accept the publique charge for foure monthes together, he ſtudied the matter day and night to be firſt well reſolved in his conſcience of the juſtice of the <hi>Venetians</hi> cauſe and of the ground of it. And while <hi>Leoni</hi> was buſie in giving the ſtile, the father called to minde a tractate in the matter of excommunication written by <hi>Gio Gerſon</hi> a Pariſian doctor, and famous for having been Chancelor of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who had taken great paines at the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> to remove a long ſchiſme which had laſted ſeaven and thirty yeares in the Romane Church, and was reputed a man of learning and piety, living and dying with a ſame of perfect holineſſe. He cauſed ſome of the greate Senators to peruſe it, who finding that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be written as if it had beene directed againſt the buſineſſe in agitation, did by their authority make the father tranſlate it into <hi>Italian,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing a ſhort epiſtle in the front, ſent it to the preſſe. Againſt which little worke, <hi>Cardinall Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> having written, and given a particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98082:53"/>to the letter in the frontiſpice, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the author with falſe interpretation, and with doctrine contrary to that of the church, and after fell to confute the little worke it ſelfe of <hi>Gerſon.</hi> The father being engaged into a neceſſitie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and withall of defending <hi>Gerſon:</hi> A booke was thereupon printed, which is now in being, and intituled the apologie of <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> in which, I am ſure that learned &amp; pious Catholikes who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not ambition, and flattery of Court before the cleare fountaines, their owne conſciences, and the ſolide Catholique doctrine, having not found any thing wanting either in the writers modeſtie, nor for depth of learning, nor in the ſufficiency of the defence, but the worke it ſelfe (being publique) let the learned and pious profeſſors of the truth be the Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoni</hi> alſo wrote, (who as in matter of elegancy and ſmooth language, gave more ſatisfaction then needed) ſo in that which concern'd ſoliditie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he came as far too ſhort. And truely it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he that of himſelfe is not capable of a matter ſhould be able to write ſubſtantially at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans information, and how much more he ſhall ſtrive by quaintnes of expreſſion to give it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, by ſo much the worke will faile and be wanting in ſolide ſence. Nor yet did it give full content to thoſe that reade it, and becauſe now in the meane time, a number of little pamphlets flew abroade in printe, which were full of petulancy and impudence, and wherein either not touching the controverſie they ſpent themſelves in ill language a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Senate, and ſeditious conceipts with the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98082:53"/>people either perverted the ſtate of the cauſe by confuting their owne fantacies, and blotting of paper in a vanitie of diſcourſe and flattering decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, or by touching the difference with ſo much ſlightneſſe diverted it to things that were impertinent. It was thought neceſſary that father <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſhould ſet pen to paper, which he did, and wrote a worke under the name and title of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderationi ſopre le cenſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the pietie and ſolidity whereof the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt are onely fit to be judges, and whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations that were made againſt it be confutations or elſe confeſſions of a deſperate cauſe. And becauſe againſt that, as at a marke, the multitude of writers ſhot all their arrowes (with which kinde of men our age is furniſht abundantly) who make their gaine the end of their writing, and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more then the truth, and among others find-that one father <hi>Bovie</hi> a Carmelite had written leaſt fooliſhly, the father was willing his booke ſhould be anſwered by a booke that was called <hi>Le confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni,</hi> under the name of <hi>Maeſtro Fulgentio,</hi> which if it deſerve commendations, muſt be onely attributed to the father, by whoſe directions and help it was compoſed. His is alſo (though curſorily written) <hi>la aggimita e ſupplimento all Hiſtoria degli uſcocchi;</hi> beſide the tediouſneſſe of the letter and documents of Signor <hi>Minuncio.</hi> And another little worke <hi>De ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aſylop Petri ſarpi Juris,</hi> which is the name that <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> was knowne by abroade. And an extract of a writing of his, made by publique order to give a rule of uniformitie how to proceede in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the immunity of conſecrate places through
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98082:54"/>the whole dominions of <hi>Venice,</hi> but it is more ample in the originall, as it was preſented to the publique containing particular lawes and treaties that had paſt with the Popes. I have ſeene in the hands of ſome of the magiſtrates a long manuſcript which treates of the office of the holy inquiſition at <hi>Venice,</hi> and of all the ſtate, but made by publique order, which although it ſeeme only reſtrained to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe of the moſt excellent common wealth, yet, it is a moſt ſingular piece, and worthie (for the exquiſitors and rare things which it containes,) that all Princes ſhould purchaſe it as a precious jewell, not onely at the weight of gold, but as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the works of <hi>Democritus</hi> were bought. But it may well be believed, that thoſe Lords which have it in poſſeſſion are not ignorant of that worth, but keepe it as a Jewell.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the works of father <hi>Paul</hi> that are ſeen abroade in written hand, or in printe under his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name; or that are certainely reputed to be his, though made upon divers occurrents. Becauſe that tractate of the interdict ſet out in propoſitions was compiled by the common conſent of the ſeaven divines, which at that time the common wealth kept together to examine their difference with the Pope. Since then, an opinion hath got footing in in divers places. But in <hi>Rome</hi> tis publiſht for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that he was the author of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> divided into eight books, and printed in <hi>Italian</hi> at London, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after tranſlated into all the moſt common languages of <hi>Europe.</hi> And it may be that <hi>Rome</hi> tooke that aſſurance, the rather becauſe for a long time
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98082:54"/>the father went gathering with extreame diligence, whatſoever he could attaine to know, either by coſt or friendſhip, ſparing no labour about the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the ſaid Councell, and not onely in <hi>Italy</hi> but abroade. And at ſuch times as it was lawfull for him to converſe with ihe Ambaſſadours of forraine Princes, which was betwixt his being a Divine, and a Canoniſt, untill his being made a conſultor of ſtate: he had all that while a free entrance into their ſecrets. He was moſt intimate with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Ferrar, Demete</hi> and <hi>Freſnes,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with <hi>Ferrier,</hi> who being preſent at the ſaid Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> had many great memorialls (and letters which are the moſt ſecure and reall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Hiſtory.) Of this wee have an argument although it be but a ſlight one which is, the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pietro Soave Polano,</hi> whoſe Anagrammatiſme makes <hi>Paolo Sarpio Veneto</hi> the name and ſurname of of the father. But in theſe kindes of encounters the matter is infinite, though the labour be but vaine; yet be it how it will, I am of opinion that a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fathers wiſdome cannot be made upon his writings, except it be with ſuch a diſcretion as the ſubtile artificer, who by the ſight of one of the clawes knows the greatneſſe of the Lion, and as in hiſtories wee finde that by the meaſure of a finger is comprehended by the rule of proportion, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vaſtitie of the <hi>Coloſsus</hi> at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> becauſe in workes that were written in ſuch a neceſſitie of difference and diſpoſitions, it was a greater ſtudy to know what was fit to be ſilenc't then what to be ſpoken. He that reades may well obſerve the great modeſtie where with he ſpeakes in a time whereas
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98082:55"/>(with ſcandall to poſteritie) he was become the object of all malignant and petulant pennes, dipt more in the poiſon of Calumny, and malediction, then of inke; yet for all this, as a man never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't, he choſe with all exquiſiteneſſe rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the cauſe which he thought to be juſt, then to make anſwer to detractions.</p>
            <p>There is alſo to be ſeene the <hi>Rubricks</hi> of 206 chapters of a worke which he had in <hi>Idea</hi> of the power of Princes, which gives ſome expectation to have beene the moſt deſir'd and important compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever appeared to the world: whereof this may ſtand for a proofe, that he had extended the three firſt chapters to ſo great a comprehenſion of matter, he having with his owne hand beſtowed the firſt draught of them upon the moſt illuſtrious Lord <hi>Giorgio Contarini.</hi> This Lord, who to the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his great houſe hath added an incomparable vivacity of wit, a ſingular judgment and other guifts which have rendred him conſpicuous, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a collection of many rare things, eſpecially of the vulgar writings of the greateſt perſons, is poſſeſt of this, and will not ſuffer it, as I believe, to goe out of his hands, becauſe ſome of his <hi>Rubricks</hi> being diſperſt into divers Countryes, where there are men of famous learning and knowledge, might ſtirre them up (if it were poſſible) to undertake a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of what the father had onely left in <hi>Idea;</hi> wherefore to ſend abroad the three ſaid chapters as they were drawne up, would rather have beene a diſcouragement then an incitation, for feare of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that deformitie which <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Humane capiti cervicem pictor equinam jungere &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98082:55"/>for otherwiſe, that Lord beſides his confidence of finding in a Frier ſuch a <hi>Magazine</hi> of eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, after he was growne acquainted, and had got an intrinſicke converſation with him, he did not honor him but (as I may ſay) he adored him like a <hi>Numen.</hi> He by his great wit being capable to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the excellency of that divine ſoule, and after the fathers death no man was ſo zealous as he to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his memory. This was he who after the father was dead (while they that ſhould have done more, tooke the leaſt care) (as it oft happens in the like caſes) cauſed his image to be made in chalke and after in mettall, that he might (as he hath done) have it graved in mother of pearle, and cut in braſſe. And in all this having not ſatisfied his fancy, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the meanes he could to get it done in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Theſe were the effects and demonſtrations a moſt generous heart, and arguments of a ſublime intellect.</p>
            <p>Here it comes to purpoſe to inſiſt upon the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt injury which churchmen had done him, to conceive ſuch an enraged hatred, and ſo unjuſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his writings and deportment, during the time that he was employed in the publique ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his actions he had alwaies abſtained from making any recrimination, and had kept all the lawes of a true divine, and one that had in greateſt veneration the ſea Apoſtolike, and the Pontificall dignity and authoritie. And I would it had pleaſed God that all men had done the like; For then the church had beene had in more honour, and that honour had extended it ſelfe further. And as for other mens writings, I would not have churchmen
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98082:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>thinke that at that very time, there was a want of perſons that made formall anſwers to ſo great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and maledictions againſt the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Common-wealth, &amp; the defenders of her cauſe.</p>
            <p>But the father <hi>Paul</hi> did by publique command with his fix other Collegues, reduce himſelfe in a Canonicall way to take examination of whatſoever was preſented to the preſſe, &amp; upon every thing there was a ſpeciall care that no offence might be given to the Court. And out of that reſpect it is, that there are ſo many other writings which were never ſuffer'd to be put in print. And the great piety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth deſerves an eternall memory, who for this end (beſides the other examen) had deputed there of the greateſt Senators for age, for merit, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who after the report was made by the ſaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, did themſelves review every thing before it went to the preſſe with a moſt curious eye, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be impertinent to the cauſe: or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the contrary part, who on the contrary part are ſo far from giving the like reſpect to them, as the world well knowes, having given an eternall ſcandall to Catholique religion and are grown to ſuch a paſſe, that the Catholick religionwith them is no more, but what their owne intereſt and arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dictates.</p>
            <p>And becauſe in the writings which at that time and fince are come forth upon ſeverall occaſions (if they may have life, whereof there is no great appearance, and much leſſe reaſon, except for this, that they favour the pretences of the <hi>Romane</hi> Court) the maledictions againſt the poore father are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, the impoſtures, the impudent Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98082:56"/>being the moſt notoriouſly falſe, that perhaps were ever invented againſt a man, whereat prudent and pious men need not wonder, but rather remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in all ages there have not wanted ſome ſuch peſtiferous penns, who to become ſervile to the Court, have adulterated ſo many tractates under the name of holy fathers, &amp; famous writers, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true narrations, brought in fabulous legends, and above all infected the world, with impoſtures and infamations of thoſe, whoſe works they were neither able to extinguiſh nor confute. But ſince the time that theſe religions are ſet on foote which are ſo much tied to the intereſſe of the Court, this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of altering, corrupting, lying, fayning, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating is growne ſo great, that if other ſects or ages ſhould be put into the ballance with them, they deſerve rather to be canonized then defended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this kinde of impudency knowes no limits but hath a foundation beyond the ordinary <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques.</hi> Ill language is of eaſie entrance, and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is ſpoken in a few words, but the confutation is of greateſt difficultie, and requires long narrations which are read with impatiency, and of but a few, and when a ſlander is once gone abroade, they are very few that thinke themſelves concern'd in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of him that is ſlandered, or in diſcovery of the truth: eſpecially ſince of the one ſide the rewards and allurements are large, and of the other ſide there comes little or no mundane advancement.</p>
            <p>But above all other theſe moderne men have their owne reaſons to be in this matter as the old ſaying is <hi>Guaviter impudentes,</hi> which is their ſecurity, that how notorious ſoever the impoſture be, yet it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98082:57"/>ſhall be faſtened to a multitude, and undoubtedly to an innumerable number of their devoted depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who without further diſcuſſion of truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every thing upon other mens credit, as did in former times the diſciples of the <hi>Eleuſinian</hi> myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or (to ſpeake nearer to the purpoſe) thoſe that were adherent to the Gnoſticks and Manichees, and other ſuch like ſects with whom it was an onely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to believe any exorbitancy, by an (<hi>Ipſe dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic</hi>) and thus much was neceſſary to be ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe writings.</p>
            <p>But in his actions <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> deſerves rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Churchmen to have a bleſſed memory. And thus much the excellent Senate and common-weale will for ever teſtifie how unjuſtly this was objected, that either he ſought to ſtir up any thing againſt the lawfull eccleſiaſticall immunities, or counſelled any thing that might redound to the diminution of the authority of the ſea Apoſtolicke. They will alſo teſtifie, with how much art and ſingular prudence he hath often tempered that ardour which (even in the moſt moderate Citiſens) the zeale of their libertie hath uſed to inflame againſt any that are reputed offendors or uſurpers of their juriſdiction. They can alſo teſtifie the great reverence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath alwaies ſpoken, and written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes and the Apoſtolicall ſea. Yet for all this moderation he could not prevent being cited to <hi>Rome</hi> to render an account of his written doctrine. To the citation he made anſwer by a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> (which is in print,) wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the nullity of the Citation, and an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of transferring himſelfe to <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98082:57"/>remaines without confutation. And the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will prove whether he had reaſon to truſt himſelfe thither, whether it were juſt that (as he had humbly petitioned) ſo a ſecure place might firſt be aſſigned him to make his defence before further proceeding. But without further (ſcruple as it was reported) he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> but there was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawfull account or reaſon yielded to declare him obnoxious to the cenſures or Eccleſiaſticke pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, it being a report, that they were ſo farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> that they would never ſuffer it to be publiſhed. Beſides he drew a long writing which was after knowne to be preſented to the Pope himſelfe, wherein he made a briefe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of many formall Hereſies and tyrannicall doctrines which are found among thoſe defenders which wrote on the Pontificall part. As for his owne writings he made them this offer, that if they would decline that ambiguous and captious way of citation, pretending him guilty of hereticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſcandalous, erroneous, offenſive to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie eares, <hi>Reſpectivè,</hi> all the reſt being made unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible by the addition of that ſtrange word, <hi>Reſpectivè</hi> but as if he had in particular, and by name gathered &amp; noted the wretched and falſe propoſitions which were in the writings of the Eccleſiaſtiks, ſo they would but deale with his writings, that then he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, himſelfe being ſecur'd in an any place among Catholikes; there to hold diſputation with any man, and preſently to retract if there were any cauſe ſhewed that required retractation. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Embaſſador anſwered his holineſſe, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him the ſaid writing which he imparted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98082:58"/>to thoſe Prelates at <hi>Rome</hi> that deſired to ſee it.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed that God the juſt Judge (at the ſame time that this tempeſt of perſecution was raiſed againſt him) was pleaſed in another kinde to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relieve him. And as his divine majeſtie doth not uſe to leave his ſervants under a greater weight, then what by his holy grace they may ſuſtaine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing troubles out of his charitie, and his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions coming from ſo high a hand. He was cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed of thoſe: great infirmities, which from his youth he had borne with an unconquered pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and under ſuch a weakneſſe of complexion, he himſelfe then being as healthfull as he could wiſh: excepting onely that of the <hi>Procidentia</hi> the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of his guts, whereof he made no great matter, having with his inſtrument found a meanes whereby it gave him no impediment at all. And the retention of his urine troubled him no more untill the ſeaventieth yeare of his age, for in this time that that wee ſpeak of he was but 55.</p>
            <p>The fathers actions of this yeare would yield us matter of too long a diſcourſe, the piety wherewith the moſt excellent Senate did governe themſelves (after ſo great an offence and continued injuries) towards our holie Catholike religion, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pope himſelfe, who had done the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,) their prudence in government, and charitie towards their ſubjects is partly ſeene in a particular relation which the father made by publique order for memories ſake, which after ſtole into the preſſe. But ſure it is that it went printed into <hi>France,</hi> and there it was reprinted. But to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98082:58"/>wee finde in the memorialls that remaine in all hiſtories, the deplorable tragedies that have ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when Popes have proceeded to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Princes and publiſh interdicts, and no leſſe when with the like cenſur's, this excellent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was injur'd being paralelled with the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this which hath continued above ſixteene monthes; the father hath herein deſerved eternall memory, or rather to be canonized for one of the moſt pious, holie, well deſerving and prudent reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, that ever ſerving Prince with uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith did likewiſe ſerve the holy Church, and the Popes themſelves. If that be true which writers of the Eccleſiaſticke part have publiſhed in ſo many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bookes, that the fathers reputation was ſuch that all his conſultations were received and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like oracles. Becauſe it was proceeded againſt thoſe religious men, who either for ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (which were very few (or by way of faction, and intereſt diſobai'd the publique orders, with ſo much favour that not any one of them was puniſht with death for any offence, and verie few deprived of libertie to goe where they liſted. A precedent ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeene upon the like occurrents in other places, wherein the moſt ſerene Common-weale made ſo little uſe of the power againſt offenders which God had given them to vindicate the injuries of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. And to ſay truth, the nature of the father was ſo mercifull, that it ſorted well with the publique Clemency, nor was he ever conſulted concerning any grievous publique offence, wherein he did not ſweeten their deliberations as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living man could doe, and excuſe whatſoever
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98082:59"/>was capable of an excuſe. To be ſhort, he never ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a ſpur to any thing but to meekeneſſe; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerved as a bridle to the prudence of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but onely in the reſtraint of ſome fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and particularly in the examination of things that were deſired to be ſent to the ſtampe. In his owne writings, all his care was to ſilence whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might give offence, not in what he could ſay in defence, for the matter was very ample, and the worke that lay upon him was more in defalcation then addition. And they that have ſeen his originalls can make faith, how much he deſired to ſtand to the cauſe without ſuffering his pen to runne riot in any thing which by interpretation might be drawne into offence, although the malitious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of ſome flatterers hath made it appeare, that there can be nothing ſo moderately ſpoken, which is not ſubject to depraved expoſitions.</p>
            <p>The faction of the Court had (among other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices) to get a victory in this controverſie, made uſe of this, to ſend divers men under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts to ſeduce (either by promiſes, or threatnings, or both) thoſe that ſerved the republique, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, thoſe religious men that made up the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſeaven divines, as it happened, That two of them deviated from the dutie of their conſciences. And truly they did their offices with ſuch violence, ſo much of threatning, as of promiſe, that if the juſtice of the cauſe of <hi>Venice</hi> had not been exceeding cleer, &amp; the infamy of deſerting it ſo notorious after the Juſt. of it examined, underſtood and defended, it had beene enough to have ſtaggered a very ſolide braine.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the conceipt of the very enemies of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98082:59"/>the fathers integritie, that having attempted all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by all their engines whereby their fidelitie might be ſhaken, they durſt not ſo much as moue the father by a word. And true it is, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the <hi>Servi Maeſtro Filippo Ferrari Aleſſandrino</hi> being an intrinſike friend of the fathers, and going from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> gave him a ſtrict commiſſion to remove from the ſervice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, two of his order, Frier <hi>Paul,</hi> and Frier <hi>Fulgentio</hi> with ample promiſes of reward. But the Generall made him anſwer, that for father <hi>Paul</hi> he thought he was able to doe no good. And going to the Cardinal <hi>de Aſcoli,</hi> with whom the father had had beene very intimate, and communicating his thoughts to him of attempting that revolt. The Cardinall told him that he had ſeene the Fathers writings, and thereby knew that it was but a loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp; not to be attempted. This great and learned Prelate underſtood the ſoliditie of the <hi>Venetian</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the fathers incorruptibilitie and his minde that was impenetrable either by allurements of Court, by ambitions, by profits or terrors. And when <hi>Don Pranceſco de Caſtro</hi> came extraordinary Embaſſadour from the Catholique King to <hi>Venice,</hi> to treate of an accommodation, having in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſome religious perſons of emenency, there was not one of them that durſt open his mouth to the father to any ſuch purpoſe. Onely one of them once ſet a net to have caught him, but in vaine. One <hi>Martino Aſdrale Vallone,</hi> one that was an excellent ſpie, came to <hi>Venice,</hi> pretending a ſatiety and ill ſatisfaction of the Court, who having long addreſt himſelfe to haunt the ſhop of <hi>Sechim</hi> (whereof you
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98082:60"/>have heard.) No man had better intelligence of what paſt at <hi>Rome</hi> concerning that controverſie then he. None more free to condemne the fury of of the <hi>Pope</hi> then he. He was of no abſurd wit, and with much practiſe he grew cunning enough to let them know that the Pope was of a vindicative ſpirit, thereby laying a foundation to his deſigne, which he had given him in charge, and it might be true.</p>
            <p>At the end of this yeare, and the comming in of 1607. the accommodation was concluded for the King of <hi>France</hi> by the meanes of the Cardinall <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> and the mediator of it had beene the Cardinall of <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> who by the interpoſition of <hi>Mounſieur de Freſnes</hi> Ambaſſador for the Chriſtian king, had uſed all diligence that the father &amp; he might meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for conference, alledging that beſides that he was comprehended by way of acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation in the publique cauſe as a counſellor, he had moreover ſpeciall commiſſions to treate with him of things concerning his owne greatneſſe. The father penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cardinalis end, giving an account thereof to the publique, and thereupon the moſt excellent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, were deſirous to heare the fathers owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, remitting the reſolution to his only prudence, and to them he gave ſuch an anſwer, that by thoſe moſt wiſe Senators it was reſolved, that he ſhould not treate with the Cardinall. And among other reaſons, the Senate never being inclined to grant either benediction or abſolution to ſuch as needed it not, they could not foreſee to what end it was to grant a private conference betwixt ſo great a Cardinall and a Frier. <q>
                  <hi>And although the Father where of himſelfe very ſparing to ſpeake, yet it was in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98082:60"/>power of others to make it more or leſſe as they pleaſed. Nor can be that ſerves a Prince have a worſe encounter being already hated for anothers ſake, then to heare a thing whereby one part may be made jealous without hopes of pleaſing the other.</hi>
               </q> When the agreement wasmade, it was one of the conditions, that the Common wealth ſhould give thankes to all thoſe that were not ſpecified by their names in that revolt. By reaſon whereof many returned backe to the ſtate that had grievouſly offended the publique. And the father was alſo comprehended in <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo,</hi> which was a thing beyond the courſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, or the doctrine of lawes, that peace being made with the Prince, it ſhould not be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be made with all his Councellors. All which afterwards the Pope himſelfe <hi>Paul</hi> the V did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ratifie to the then Embaſſador, <hi>Franceſco Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarini;</hi> (and at this day the moſt ſerene Prince and Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>) And the truth of thus much ſhall be verified by things ſubſequent. That the Pope ſpeaking of father <hi>Paul in individuo</hi> ſaid, that he had given his benediction to all, and was not willing there ſhould be any more words of what had paſt.</p>
            <p>Vpon which promiſes of ſo great a Prince, and upon the integritie of his owne conſcience, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repoſing himſelfe in all cleereneſſe and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, ſerving his naturall Prince with that faith and diligence which he kept incomparably to his laſt breath. It fell after divers times into debate, whether the father ſhould goe to viſite the <hi>Nuntio Geſſi,</hi> that was ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> after that accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was anſwered that it was but an office per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in relation to their owne Embaſſador at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98082:61"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and howſoever that it was but an expreſſion of reverence; And it being referred to his owne conſultation: He for his part ſhewed himſelfe moſt willing, but yet with regard had to the manner how <hi>Nuntios</hi> uſe to treate with the Prince himſelfe, having power to colour their treaty with a pretext of religion; whereupon it was reſolved, that he onely uſe a ſet forme of preciſe words that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him from the moſt excellent Colledge. And further what he ſhould tolerate, and what he ſhould replie to, in caſe the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> as he pretended, ſhould fall upon the cauſe. This had ſo much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of opinions and contrariety, that the buſineſſe without reſolution fell to the ground. But it hath ſince happened, that the greateſt Prelates of this ſtate, as well Patriarchs as Biſhops, have indifferently upon all occaſions treated with the father of theſe affaires, ſome viſiting him in his Monaſtery, and others ſending to invite him to their houſes.</p>
            <p>It fell out at this time when the differences were already compoſed in <hi>Venice,</hi> that <hi>Gaſparo Scioppio</hi> a man well knowne to the world by his writings in printe, coming from <hi>Rome</hi> to paſſe into <hi>Germany</hi> (as he ſaid) or that he brought with him (as it was alſo ſaid) a writing full of reproach againſt the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique to be printed in <hi>Germany,</hi> beſide, other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings full of impiety (as that of Frier <hi>Tomaſo Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi> a Dominican (who having attempted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray <hi>Coſenza</hi> into the Turks hands) was at that time kept a priſoner in the caſtle of the egg by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; In that of this, he gave documents to the King and government of <hi>Spaine,</hi> how under certaine pretexts of religion they might impropriate the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98082:61"/>or elſe ſtir up his Holineſſe to raiſe new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies againſt the leſſer princes, continuing the practiſe untill he found an opportunitie to ſeaze upon their eſtates, and ſo proceeding as he would have the Spaniards doe, untill they had gotten the Pontificate into one of their owne, that they might be both King and Pope at once, or elſe that the Pope might be held on as an inſtrument of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of others. Whether it were for this, or for any other ſecret cauſe that he had incurr'd publique indignation, he was detained in priſon three or 4 daies (if they were ſo many) and afterwards by publique order he had libertie to goe where he liſted.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Schoppio</hi> was deſirous to treat with the father, and they diſcourſed together in matters of learning very long, and particularly of the doctrine of the ancient ſtoicke, which he profeſſed he would recall to light out of the thick darkneſſe wherein it was obſcured, beſides many other learned thoughts of his, and very much alſo in matter of ſtate, eſpecially concerning the proteſtants of <hi>Germany.</hi> And ſo fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into neerer diſcourſe with the father, he began to let him know that the Pope like a great Prince had long hands, and having conceived ſome deepe offence againſt him, it was impoſſible but that it would fall heavy upon him, and that if he had defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have him ſlaine he did not want the meanes.</p>
            <p>But that the Popes intent was to have him alive into his hands and to fetch him from <hi>Venice,</hi> and bring him to <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet nevertheleſſe he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe (whenſoever he pleaſed) to treate for his reconciliation, and with as much honour as he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98082:62"/>could deſire, affirming that he had many treaties in charge with the proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their converſions. To this the father anſwered, that he had done nothing for which his Holineſſe had reaſon to be offended, that he had defended a a juſt cauſe. That he was extreamely ſory that ſuch a defence as was made, ſhould be encountred with the Popes indignation; That in the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was individually comprehended, and that he could no way preſuppoſe a falling of publique faith in a Prince. But as concerning his being ſlaine, that that of all things troubled him the leaſt. That it was a thing plotted againſt Emperors, executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings, and great Princes, not againſt private men of ſo low a fortune as his was. But if ſuch a thing were deſign'd againſt him, he ſaid he was prepared to ſubmit himſelfe to the divine pleaſure, and that he was not ſo ignorant of humane condition, but that he knew what was to be thought both of life and death, and whether (of him that knew them both well,) they were either of them to be deſired or feared more then was neceſſary. And if he ſhould cauſe him to be taken alive, and carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all the power of a Pope could not arrive at this, to make another man patrone of his life before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that he was reſolved to be the patrone of his owne life before the Pope. For the reſt he gave him many thanks for his good affection, not caring to make any partie for him ſelfe, or his owne ſafety, ſince his cauſe was ſo united with the publique, that they could not be diſjoyned.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two propoſitions of killing or taken him alive ſeemed ſomewhat ſtrange, but that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98082:62"/>not long after will make it cleere that <hi>Sciop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> ſpake upon good ground, and that the things were already deſigned. He went away from <hi>Venice,</hi> and in a ſatyricall compoſition relating that he had congreſſe with father <hi>Paul.</hi> He atteſted that he had found him <hi>nec indoctum nec tumidum.</hi> But the father was ſo good of himſelfe, that he was not able to thinke an il thought, but believed whether that theſe were both conceipts of <hi>Scioppio,</hi> beſides that of his owne nature he was beyond meaſure undaunted, and being ſo reſign'd to the will of God, he lived moſt confident in his owne innocency. And though he were often admoniſht to have a care of himſelfe, by thoſe Lords that were the Inquiſitors of ſtate (this is a ſupreame Magiſtrary in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> to whom many ſecret things are made knowne) to whom intimation was given, that there was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chination againſt the fathers life, which they (in their charitie) as often warn'd him of that he might be put upon his guard; yet he ſeemed to take no care of himſelfe, either out of the greatneſſe of his ſpirit (as they that have had often experience can give aſſurance) or elſe by being ſecure that nothing could happen without the divine diſpoſition, and that thoſe things which are appointed by God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hindred by any humane caution or warning, but that rather many times too much caution &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude are among the cauſes of contrary events, and eſpecially in ſuch accidents, where travell may be both uncertaine and infinite. Certainely he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enclined to change his accuſtomed manner of life in the leaſt kinde, but would ever ſay, that it was indifferent to him to die this way or that way,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98082:63"/>onely that he might die juſtified becauſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that in no way death ſhould ever take him unprovided. And among the excellent vertues of this man, it was not the leaſt, that he never valued his life, ſo it is a rare example of him that hath this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution rooted in his minde, that it is an indifferent thing either to live or to die.</p>
            <p>Six moneths after this accommodation happened an accident, which gave the world much to talke of, and confirmed <hi>Schioppio</hi> that he had not ſpoken in the aire, nor that thoſe iterated admonitions to the father to guard himſelfe were ſuperfluous; becauſe in the evening of the firſt of <hi>October</hi> about 3 of the clock, the father returning home to his convent from <hi>Saint Marco a Santa Foſca,</hi> and coming downe neare the foote of the bridge, was aſſaulted by five aſſaſines, a part making watch, and the reſt to doe execution. So that the innocent father had three wounds with ſtillettoes; whereof two were given him in the necke, and one in his face, which entred at the right eare and came out againe betwix his noſe and his right cheeke. The aſſaſine could not pul backe his ſtilletto, becauſe it had paſt the bone where itſtucke ſo faſt, &amp; went ſo far in that it was bearded. In the ſucceſſe of humane things, divine providence is ever to be admired, where humane prudence va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes out of ſight, it being moſt certaine that in actions there is an eternall force, and a long chaine of cauſes, ſo far without us, that neither our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor any conſideration of ours, can ever come neare. It was above three monthes that the father (except that night) was never left alone, but had in his company beſide <hi>Fra. Marino</hi> his ſervant, <hi>Padre
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98082:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fulgentio,</hi> with another companion of ſpirit and valour.</p>
            <p>For although the caveats to looke to himſelfe were now very frequent, yet theſe religious men walkt about with an intire confidence, fearing no ill, becauſe they knew they did none, but had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ſo juſt a cauſe, and believing that the heate of the controverſie being once over, no man could be of ſo impious and tyrannicall a minde to preſume (after ſo ſolemne an accommodation) to give the world and all Princes ſo wicked an example, or to thinke that Princes had not learned perſons alwaies about them to be able to defend their actions, but that they muſt employ murtherers, and cutthroates. That night it happened he was left by <hi>Padre Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and his other companion, and it was upon this occaſion. Two daies before by a caſuall fire, there were ſome houſes burnt in a ſtreet that leades to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Saint Markes,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentio</hi> hearing men talke of a fire, and that it could not be extinguiſht, was deſirous to goe ſee it, asking the fathers leave, and intending at his returne to goe home with him. But making his ſtay ſomewhat longer then he intended, and believing the father to be gone home by the way of <hi>Saint Lio,</hi> came home himſelfe to the Monaſtery, by reaſon whereof the father was that onely time left ſo long together with his onely ſingle compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who having behind him ſwords drawne and gunnes, was ſeized by one of the murtherers, and had his armes ſtreight pinniond behinde him, while another of the murtherers thought he had diſpatcht the father, and thereupon gave over, leaving behind (as it is ſaid) the ſtilletto in the wound, then they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98082:64"/>tooke up their gunnes into their hands to terrifie ſuch perſons as were like to make noiſe or purſue them. After which <hi>Fra. Marino</hi> being left by him that held him bound, and ſeeing three other of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers ſtand together and ſhoote their gunnes, he tooke his heeles and ranne away in a fright. A good old man <hi>Aleſſandro Malipiero</hi> deſerves much to be remembred upon this occaſion for a ſincere and vertuous ſoule adorn'd with ſolide piety without hypocriſie, a friend of truth. This good man being very nobly borne was yet more noble in the integritie of his life being of a conſtant and wiſe judgment in a decrepiteage, and had uſed every evening to accompany the father (to whom he bare a ſingular love and reverence) which was alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable betwixt them. He went a little way before the father, ſo that by the advantage of the bridge, the Aſſaſine had a full opportunity to ſtrike and gave him fifteene ſtabbes, with his ſtilletto as it was ſeene by ſome gentlewomen who ſtood in their windowes, and the holes were afterward counted in his hood, and the coller of his doublet, but he was onely wounded by three of them, wherein is eaſily ſeene a particular divine protection, which depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the murtherer both of his wit and force, who with one light ſtabbe either in his flanke or the chine of his back might have ſlaine this innocent man, that all the while neither ſtir'd nor ſpoke one word, but (as himſelfe after reported) he thought that at the two firſt ſtilletato's he felt like two blowes ſtrucken with fire at one inſtant, and at the third, as if a great weight had fallen upon him with ſome aſtoniſhment, which he felt but in a confuſed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98082:64"/>manner. The women in the windowes raiſed an outcry, and the Signor <hi>Malipiero</hi> turnd backe againe and ſeeing the ſtilletto ſticking faſt in the fathers head with all his ſtrength puld it out and began to cry out murder, and perceived immediately two of them with their piſtolls in their hands running downe the ſtreete of <hi>Saint Marcilian,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Corte vecchia della miſerecordia,</hi> at the end of which they had a <hi>gondola</hi> ready, and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that tarried for them, from whence they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in the houſe of the Popes nuntio, then reſident at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> and from thence the ſame night they paſt to the ſhore, where having prepared a flat boate with ten oares and well armed (which waited for them) they went therin towards <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or (as ſome ſaid) to <hi>Ferrara.</hi> But it being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd, &amp; underſtood that the <hi>Aſſaſines</hi> had firſt ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred themſelves in the Nuncios houſe, the inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and concourſe of the people was ſo great, that although it were very late at night, the houſe was ſurrounded, and what with reproachfull words, and popular clamours, the perſon of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> himſelfe was ſeene to be in manifeſt danger; The high coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celloften were faine to ſend him a numerous and publique guard to prevent the occaſion of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous inconvenience. The murtherers were not ſo quickly purſued as they might have been by another ſtrange accident. Some <hi>Comaedians</hi> who were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that night to repreſent at the theater which was at <hi>Saint Luigi,</hi> where there was acted one of thoſe Comedies which they call <hi>Opera conintermedii,</hi> a Comedy with muſicke, and there was come thither all the neighbourhood; ſo that in thoſe ſtreetes of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98082:65"/>the pariſh of <hi>Santa Foſca,</hi> the like number of people had not beene ſeene together at any time, by reaſon whereof the murtherers had a more ſecure retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The executioner of this aſſaſinate was one <hi>Ridolfo Poma,</hi> who at firſt being a merchant in <hi>Venice,</hi> and eſteemed for a man of honor, but failing three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was retired to <hi>Naples</hi> for the recovering of ſome of his debts, and from thence he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was alſo well reſpected. But every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wonder at the intimacy which he had got with the Cardinall <hi>Borgheſi,</hi> who brought him to his uncle the Pope, from whom by great favour he obtained a promiſe that two of his daughters (which were left in the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi>) ſhould be received Nunnes into a Monaſtery there. And he put ſome of his friends into an amazement by writing to them, that ere long (having recovered ſome of his debts) they ſhould ſee him in a gallant conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by his letters it might be gathered that he conceived hopes as high as to be made a Cardinall. This was the conductor of the plot, together with one <hi>Aleſſandro Parrhaſio</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and there were companions added to them, <hi>Giovani</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Paul,</hi> who that he might remaine at <hi>Venice</hi> without being ſuſpected till the treaſon were grown ripe for execution, cauſed himſelfe to be liſted with a company of other ſouldiers, which were to ſerve under a captaine of ſome ſhips that were bound for <hi>Soria</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And one other there was by the name <hi>Paſquale da Bitonto,</hi> who was alſo in in pay with another company, being all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented men in ſuch kinde of profeſſions, as it may be well concluded by the reſt of their bands,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98082:65"/>who were all, or for the moſt part either baniſht men, or fugitives.</p>
            <p>The ſpie or guide of the plot, was a Prieſt <hi>Michiel Viti</hi> of <hi>Berganio</hi> who had ſometimes officiated in the holy Trinity in <hi>Venice,</hi> which puts us out of doubt, how many monthes this buſineſſe had beene hatching before it came to light. Becauſe this Prieſt in lent before, under colour of being much taken with the ſermons of father <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> had uſed to go every morning into the convent of the <hi>Servi,</hi> to the dore of the pulpit (which anſwers to the inner part of the convent) and treated with him verie courteouſly, to be ſatisfied by him in ſome ſcruples of conſcience, and continued his reſpects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day by ſaluting him and conferring with him of things which concerne the ſoule. So ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and ordinarily is religion made a ſtalking horſe or inſtrument of the greateſt wickedneſſe by thoſe who being either falne from a right courſe, or elſe faſcinated by ſome more potent error, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be guided by a blinde obedience.</p>
            <p>Before the ſucceſſe of this curſed act, father <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio</hi> had many times obſerved, that as he came home with the father over the bridge of <hi>Santa Foſca</hi> either at the one or at the other end of the bridge, he had ſeldome or never failed to encounter one while with one, and another time with two ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which proved afterwards to be thoſe verie murderers. And becauſe he perceived that they lookt narrowly upon the father, and being gone paſt him, turned againe to looke backe after him, he began to adviſe him of ſome danger that was toward him. But the father reprehended him of too much curioſitie
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98082:66"/>and ſuſpition, becauſe ſuch things as muſt take effect can by no humane foreſight be prevented.</p>
            <p>Before we returne to the wounded father I would deſire the reader to tollerate a little tranſtempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and digreſſion concerning the murtherers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the minde is ſeldome ſatisfied without hearing ſomething of matter of events. It was verified by publique report, that when <hi>Ridolſo Poma</hi> came with his confederates to <hi>Venice,</hi> he tooke up a thouſand crownes at the chamber of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and coming to <hi>Ravenna</hi> after the fact, with the newes that father <hi>Paul</hi> was ſlaine, he was honorably welcomed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo ſaid that from the chamber of <hi>Ravenna</hi> he received a thouſand crovnes more, but this I doe not affirme, becauſe I have it not upon any certainety. There he got a coach and a guard of armed men, and in the other rites of <hi>Romagna</hi> they went with their <hi>Harquebuſes</hi> in a kind of triumph. So in their way as they went they were entertained and careſſt in all places by Governours untill they came to <hi>Ancona,</hi> whether the fame by Sea being got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, that the father was wounded but not dead, did turne their glory into ſome Ecclipſe. Then they arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> where though they were well received with aſſignation of entertainement: yet their expectation was unſatisfied and there they continued untill they fell all into their ſeverall diſaſters.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt <hi>Michel Viti</hi> was clapt up in priſon in the Tower of <hi>Nona</hi> (whereof I could never yet know the certaine cauſe) where finding a Frier of father <hi>Pauls</hi> order in priſon, who told others of his order, the fooliſh things which he had heard from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98082:66"/>
               <hi>Michel Viti,</hi> and what promiſes had beene made him &amp; the manner of the whole buſineſſe, wherein he ſaid he had done the Church very great ſervice. As for <hi>Poma</hi> as he was apprehended by a provoſt marſhall he was ſhot above the him, or ſo wounded that he died of it. His ſonne that was with him, and he, were ſent to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> where he died in priſon very miſerably. There was alſo ſeene ſome yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another ſonne of <hi>Pomiani</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> a young man of great ſtature, and beautiful aſpect, but out of his wits, and followed in the ſtreete by a company of boyes, ragged in clothes, and begging his bread. He was borne for an example of Gods punniſhment which paſſeth from fathers to their children by a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible viſitation.</p>
            <p>Of the other three I cannot tell the particular ſucceſſes, nor which of them was beheaded at the Caſtle of <hi>Perugia.</hi> But true it is, they came all to ill ends. And becauſe in <hi>Rome</hi> after they were ſecur'd and ſtipended for a time, it came after to a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of caſting them into priſon, or baniſhing them (as effect made it appeare,) ſo the cauſe is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement, as it ordinarily comes to paſſe in the reſolution of great Princes. It was imputed to their impatience becauſe the promiſes were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it being reported that <hi>Poma</hi> was to receive 10000 crownes, and the others very great ſummes, which was the cauſe why they began to ſpeake in derogation of the Cardinall <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> and of the Pope himſelfe in extravagant language, diſcovering too cleerly that which was unperfectly executed, could have no abſolute praiſe nor due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, no not from thoſe that could have given luſtre
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98082:67"/>to a thing that was done, and had therefore beene better wrapt up in ſilence. Then it was ſaid or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them that they held a conſpiracy to kill both <hi>Borgheſe</hi> and the Pope. (Such is the faecunditie of finding out cauſes in Courts, and eſpecially in <hi>Italy.</hi>) That which I conceive more probable is that was told me by a Prelate now living, that about the ſame time <hi>Ridolfo</hi> the Emperor being dead, and his brother <hi>Matthias</hi> to ſucceede him, the Pope ſent the Cardinall <hi>Mellini</hi> as his legate into <hi>Germany</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene in that action, upon thoſe ordinary pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Popes have had alawies in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Emperors. At his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he told them that the Catholiques of <hi>Germany</hi> tooke very great ſcandall, that perſons which were guilty of ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed crimes ſhould finde entertainement at <hi>Rome.</hi> and that thereupon the Heretikes tooke occaſion to publiſh odious writings againſt the perſon of the Pope, and to the reproach of all the order of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls. This diſcourſe came to the Popes eares, or was elſe fomented by the bold words which were ſpoken concerning the non-payment of the 10000 crownes which had beene promiſed, and thereupon a juſt provocation given.</p>
            <p>True it is, that he gave order they ſhould be put away from <hi>Rome,</hi> although not without entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in other places. This ſeemed to them a thing of ſo much ſharpneſſe that they began to lament that they were betraied, and that thoſe were not the promiſes which had beene made them, and for which they had put themſelves upon ſuch evident dangers of dying upon gibbets, and now to faile with them in matter of faith, and in ſuch manner as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98082:67"/>had beene infamous among the very <hi>Turkes,</hi> but the provoking ſo much the mindes of thoſe great men, that are impatient of the leaſt in jurie, was the cauſe that the foreſaid ill fortune fell ſo heavy upon them, approving that old ſaying. <q>
                  <hi>That no kinde of Traytors are pleaſing to Princes, and that divine juſtice though with a lame foote failes not to overtake the ſwifteſt forerunners.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now returning to our wounded father, the firſt thing (after his wounds were bound up and he tumbled upon his bed) was to prepare himſelfe in his ſoule to God; to receive (as he did the next morning) the moſt holie communion in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt humility, entreating all the other fathers that were preſent with many teares in their eyes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, if by the impediment of his wounds he were not able to ſpeake much (as he deſired to have done,) that he might by greater demonſtrations of the ſorrow for his ſins have begged a pardon of God. And (as it is the order of that Government) the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogador</hi> being come to take his examen, (who was then <hi>Signor Girolamo Triviſano,</hi> and at this time Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in <hi>Candia</hi>) the father told him, that he had no enemy that he knew of, nor had he knowne any. Onely he praied the high Councell often that as he with all his heart did pardon him that offended him; ſo they would make no other demonſtration of it, but what might ſerve to defend him better, if God ſhould be pleaſed to prolong his life any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, expreſſing in his actions as a chriſtian, and ſonne of the heavenly father, his due obedience to the Goſpell, and as a Philoſopher that he had era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated out of his ſoule all ſpirit of revenge (which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98082:68"/>is a kinde of ſavage Juſtice, but deeply inſerted into humane nature.) It was not a ſingular action of his upon this offence alone but obſerved by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and after in the whole courſe of his life, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to procure a revenge although the injurie were never ſo great, and the moſt that was ever heard come forth of that bleſſed mouth of his caſe of his wrongs though moſt unſufferable in words or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or actions, was to ſay ſometimes with a ſerene face, <hi>Videat Dominus &amp; requirat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning the Generall <hi>Filippo Aleſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drino,</hi> hearing of the buſineſſe, came in all haſt to viſite him; (having beene intimate friends together) and when he had heard how the buſineſſe had been acted. He fell into ſuch an amazement that having communicated his commiſſions to <hi>Fra. Fulgentio,</hi> he remained for a while ſpeechleſſe.</p>
            <p>But obſerving his owne order in avoiding oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or unneceſſary ſhewes of weakneſſe; it fell into conſideration whether he ſhould uſe the help of more then one for his infirmitie, and ſo he was willing that <hi>Signor Alviſe Rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra</hi> a young man but very diſcreete and in Chirurgerie of a light hand, and no hard binding, ſhould giue attendance upon him. But the condition of his perſon, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique reſpects conſtrained him to give way that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the famous Phyſicians and Chirurgions in <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould have a hand in his cure (beſide ſuch, as by publique order came thither from <hi>Padua</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was <hi>Girolamo Fabritio, Aquapendente</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old friend &amp; an admirer of the fathers vertues) And he was commanded not to ſtirre from the Convent, (being aſſiſted by <hi>Adriano Spigelio</hi> who ſuceeded in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98082:68"/>the <hi>Anatomy Lecture</hi> at <hi>Padua</hi>) untill it might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned whether the maladie would determine to life, or death, it being very long in doubt of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whether the one or the other. Becauſe beſide that the wounds themſelves were very grievous, and much more by the complexion of that was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being ſo extenuated in nature that when at the beſt, he ſeemed but a Skeleton (ſo diſtinctly might his bones be numbered) as alſo by ſo great a Ioſſe of blood, that left him almoſt bloodleſſe, continuing morethen 20 daies before he could move or life up hand. To this was added another accidentall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which was reall. The multiplicity of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which is a miſery common to great perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome were of opinion that the wounds by the blackneſſe of their orifice gave an argument of a poiſoned weapon, and others that the treacle in the medicaments had cauſed inflammations, and it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſome that the inflammation went not farre, but might be pared away, whereby the patient was forced to ſuffer as much by his Phyſicians as by the diſeaſe, which was very long with divers recru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcencies and prognoſtiques both of life and death. In all which continuance the father behaved himſelfe with his wonted piety and conſtancy. Wherein he was much to be admired; nor did he forbeare in his greateſt dolours ſometime to pleaſe himſelfe with his owne conceipt. As at one time he ſet all the Phyſicians, and Chirurgions a laughing, that were not leſſe then a dozen about him, becauſe as he was in dreſſing, <hi>Aquapendente</hi> ſaid that the greateſt wound was not yet cured, the father ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely replied, I, but the world will have it that it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98082:69"/>was given <hi>Stylo Romanae curiae.</hi> And the ſame night being laid in his bed, and being told that the ſtile was there which was left ſticking in his head, he cauſed it to be brought him, and having felt it with his fingers he ſaid immediatly it is not filed.</p>
            <p>Not many houres after, there ran a fame that the aſſaſines where apprehended. Thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and yet alive, make faith that upon the newes he ſeemed to be much diſpleaſed ſaying, perhaps they may diſcover ſomething that may give ſcandall to the world, and prejudice to religion, which wee may the better believe he ſaid, becauſe he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved aſſurance, that they had betaken themſelves to the houſe of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> as alſo of the tumult which wee told you of. But in the whole courſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie he never ſhewed the leaſt ſigne of paine, as in emplaſtering, in cutting to widen orifices, which being made with a ſtile, and ſo deepe, require dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the rules of art. And becauſe the bone of the upper jaw was broken, many times when the wounde made a ſhew of healing, nature making abſceſſe to expell corruption, renewed alwaies the inflammations with exceſſes of conſiderable fevers untill ſuch time as it was abſolutely healed, and the ſcarres remaining in his face, both at the entrance, and comming forth of the weapon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aleſſandro Malipiero</hi> would have the ſtile as due to him becauſe he puld it out of the wound. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſucceſſe, which if it were not full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, was yet a particular demonſtration of divine providence, and the moſt ſpeciall cuſtody of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent father, ſo he was content it ſhould be hung at the feete of a crucifixe in the Church of the <hi>Servi,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98082:69"/>(where it yet remaines) with this inſcription, <hi>Dei filio liberatori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day after the receipt of his wounds he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the newes of the death of <hi>Mounſieur de Maiſſe,</hi> which afflicted him with an immenſe griefe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he made demonſtration to <hi>Pietro Aſſileneo</hi> ſaying. <hi>Wee have loſt our deare friend</hi> Monſieur de Maiſſe. <hi>This is a wound which admits no remedy. And in this humane condition of ours where among friends wee muſt expect to be either a ſpectator, or a ſpectacle, and as the father loved him ſincerely ſo in his loſſe he became ſenſible of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt ſerene Republique could not make a greater demonſtration of their reſpects to the father, nor of their publique diſcontent upon that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nor of their munificence (their ordinary propertie) nor of their charitie toward him that had beene their ſervant, becauſe upon the newes of the accident, the excellent Senate that were then aſſembled, broke up immediatly without proceeding any further, with an univerſall murmur of condole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Councell often being alſo met (who have the judicature of the greateſt criminall cauſes) &amp; there was that evening ſo great a concourſe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators in the Convent of the <hi>Servi,</hi> that one would have thought that they had intended to have held a Senate in the place.</p>
            <p>They ſent money to the Monaſtery to beſpent upon the cure. And beſides the reſort of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Senators, that ordinarily viſited him; He was ſent to every day by publique perſons, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate commanded that the Phyſicians ſhould goe to attend the Senate to make a true relation of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98082:70"/>ſtate of the father, and with a rich recompence of a chaine and Medalls; the Signor <hi>Aquapenden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> was created Cavaglier, for having attended upon the cure. And as for ſecuring the fathers perſon in time to come whatſoever was imaginable was done. As for the murtherers who were preſently knowne, and diſcovered by particulars from whence they came, and whither they went, they gave them ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the higheſt nature that the Supreame Councell had ever done to any for crimes of the greateſt exceſſe. They printed proclamations alſo with promiſe of ample rewards to the people or any man that at any time upon the like occaſion (if any ſhould attempt to offend the father) ſhould raiſe themſelves to kill or apprehend the attemptors of any ſuch offence with the ſame rewards propoſed to whoſoever ſhould make a diſcovery to juſtice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plot or machination againſt the ſaid father. They gave allowance alſo for the keeping of a guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him with libertie to beare armes arm'd of any ſort, and for maintayning thereof an encreaſe of ſtipend, with a houſe at <hi>Saint Marks</hi> at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique charge where he might remaine in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.</p>
            <p>But the father was reſolved never to change his courſe of life, and beſought them that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Monaſtery among his brethren, with whom he had lived untill that age, affirming that he could not tell how to live otherwiſe, and that was his calling, wherein they were content to gratifie him, onely cauſing ſome little buildings to be added to his chamber, from whence by a little gallery, and a ladder he might have the commodity to take boat;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98082:70"/>that when it happened he was to returne from the publique ſervice home to the Monaſtery by night, he might not be expoſed to trechery.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity yet conſtrained him in parte to make an eternall change of the tenor of his life. Becauſe (howbeit the ſerene Republique had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning aſſumed him into their ſervice by aſſigning him a convenient ſtipend, yet) he untill thoſe very times was never willing to make uſe of more then neceſſity required without declining at all from the rigour of his religion, nor the povertie thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with that ſimple food and rayment without any alteration.</p>
            <p>But by this accident he was conſtrained to go no more on foote from the <hi>Servi</hi> to <hi>Saint Marks,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary to have paſt through ſome blinde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys which had given opportunity to ſuch as ſought his life, but to uſe the commoditie of gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes. For which conſideration in ſixteene yeares fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he hath beene accuſtomed to embarke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, landing at the <hi>Rialto</hi> to goe the reſt of that little ſtreete of the mercery in ſecurity being ſo frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it is, and by the advantage of a daily exerciſe to keepe himſelfe in abilitie of walking, likewiſe he foreſaw a neceſſitie of having a companions; the one to ſerve him, and the other for a writer; to <hi>Fra. Marco</hi> which was one of them he gave him at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times ſix hundred duccats (beſides a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew of 50 <hi>per An.</hi>) and upon the other <hi>Fra. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> 300 in banke to put forth 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> becauſe he might have a ſubſiſtance, and afterward 40 <hi>per Annum.</hi> And beſides this in the Convent it was thought neceſſary for him to enlarge his hand to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98082:71"/>thoſe that managed bread and wine, and to ſome cookes he gave no leſſe then 60 duccats in one yeare. Nor will any that ſhall reade his life, eſteeme it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imprudence or prodigallity, but the neceſſary defence of his owne life. He went yet further to give largely upon all occaſions, and to be liberall among his conventualls, which things gayning him more benovelence, and intereſting many in his conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did likewiſe engage him to give over that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gide reſolutiom of not accepting thoſe proviſions which were aſſigned him from the publique munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which alſo enabled him to exerciſe thoſe acts of liberallitie. The habite of which vertue was ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to him, that when he was at the pooreſt of his fortune he never denied any thing that was asked him, whether it were money if he had it, or elſe any of his bookes. And if it were not of neceſſary uſe to himſelfe, his parting with it was an irrevocable giving it away. And in theſe latter times that he was able to give almes and guifts, he hath given ſo much to ſome one man that deſired it of him by way of loane, that he that knowes it affirmes by good proofe that it did amount to above 2000 duccats. And his manner of lending was alwaies with this condition, that except he redemanded it, they ſhould never offer to repay him (as one that was willing to give in ſuch a way, that the thing that he gave, ſhould not have ſo much of meaneneſſe and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie that it might be ſaid to be beſtowed.) And very often he had in his mouth this ſaying <hi>Imitiamo Dio e la natura,</hi> let us &amp;c. who whatſoever they give they never expect againe, and let us avoide that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon error of ſuch as thinke that to lend is to loſe,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98082:71"/>or elſe put a friend to bluſh or be aſſured.</p>
            <p>He made another change alſo in this, that from that time forward, while he lived, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver converſt abroade out of his chamber, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, except it were in publique places, as the Church and the quire, or coming to divine offices, or to the refectory at meales. His life being ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Hermite like and totally ſolitary, as farre as the publique ſervice could diſpence with it, and his narrow world was confined to his poore cell, and that little path betwixt the <hi>Rialto</hi> and <hi>Saint Marke.</hi> Which is but the ſtreet of the <hi>Merzaria</hi> ſpending the reſt of his time in the exerciſes of his ſoule in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver interrupted ſtudies, and in the ſervice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, or of his private neighbours; it being come to that paſſe, that in all ſorts of buſineſſe they came to him for advice, and he gave anſwer to all with ſuch meekneſſe and profunditie, as if he had beene every mans advocate, and to this particular purpoſe two ſtrange things fell into obſervation. The one that never any thing was propoſed to him, whereto he did not as readily and ſolidely give an anſwer, as if it had beene in his onely profeſſion, and yet he gave no reſolution nor anſwer ſo ſodainly that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be and ſtudiouſly conſidered of, and ſuch an one as it was impoſſible to be bettered, and in ſixteene yeares there ſeldome happened any matter of conſequence wherin he was not conſulted becauſe from all the cities that were ſubject to the ſigniory, in the moſt difficult cauſes his opinion was alwaies deſired, as in teſtaments, in matrimonies, in feoffments, in hereditaments, and even as farre as in pointes of honor for the making of peace.</p>
            <p>I omit thoſe publique reſpects wich concerne the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98082:72"/>ſubſtance of government. In matters of benefices ſo abſtruſe and various, in all kinde of Eccleſiaſtike controverſies, it is a ſtrange thing that his foote ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trode awry, no not ſo much as that the whole Court of <hi>Rome</hi> could ever finde any thing in his judgments that was fit for reproofe. But as oft as it happened that things went to conſultation, although to the famous univerſities and colledges, if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were of a different opinion from thoſe that gave anſwer at the inſtance of the partie, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies concluded in matter of judgment that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had hit the naile on the head. In all ſuites and proceſſes of private perſons, his anſwers were alwaies taken for oracles.</p>
            <p>And here I may ſummon the conſciences of a number of people that live, to acknowledge this for a truth, and whether in all thoſe conſultations which ſurpaſſe thouſands, he hath ever beene knowne to erre in his judgment. This is the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him that writes the life of this divine ſoule, that thoſe things which ſeeme hyberpolicall, and meerly Rhetoricall, come not neare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that which is, &amp; which was more in fact then can be related. Of matters of government it will not be neceſſarie to ſay more then what the moſt excellent Senate (the very <hi>Idea</hi> of politique Chriſtian prudence) knowes. Another thing was rare in him, that having yielded his ſervice freely in private cauſes as well of the Church as ſecular (as if guifts had had a power of enchantment according to that fiction of the poets <hi>Muneribus Divi placantur</hi> and thereby an adminiſtration given to all men to take heede of receiving them, ſo he would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98082:72"/>a recognition from any man, whatſoever, not of the leaſt valew, as others in the like kinde did or would have done, and ſome have enricht themſelves by great ſummes of money that have not taken paines to the tenth part of his employment. Beſides many who underſtanding his merits, have attempted to fix a guift upon him; yet to the glorie of God and of this excellent creature, there is no man alive that can ſay that ever he received the leaſt gratuity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies content with this onely reward of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done well, and if when God and the publique were ſerved he had any ſpare time, he would not loſe a minute from reading or hearing others reade or forming Mathematicall figures upon papers or aſtronomicall deſignes of divers inſtruments, which when he had after torne in pieces, it was to ſhew that he did it but to paſſe away time. The greateſt part of his time he beſtowed upon the new teſtament and upon the moralls. In matters of experiment the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding is unſatiable, ſuch was the life of this father, ſingularly compoſed of active and contemplative, alwaies yielding to God what he could; to his Prince what he ought; and of that which belonged to his owne dominion more then he ought by any law but that of charity.</p>
            <p>But yet nevertheleſſe, this is ſo pious, ſo holy an inſtitute and order of his was not able to pleaſe the implacable, as it happens with engines of many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and inſtruments that though the motion tooke beginning from ſome principall wheele neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that impreſſion which it makes upon others doth not ceaſe, though the principall move no more, nay rather that impreſſion which is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98082:73"/>the leſſer Pieces drawes after it with violence that piece which gave motion from the beginning. So in ſome governments the motion that tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Prince and was derived, and after divided among many miniſters; followes and continues a motion in them, although the Prince have abandonde it; in like manner it happens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning hatred and malevolence. That the intereſt of Court advancements take deepe roote with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that perſwade themſelves they ſhall doe the Pope a verie great ſervice, and ti's growne almoſt naturall for men to ſhew that they having an affection to that which at firſt they tooke from others, (being none of their owne but fained that they may arrive at ſome end of their owne,) and ſo in progreſſe of time forgetting themſelves become really tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their affection, the like being alſo obſervable in the corporall affections of nature, as in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſeaſes of fancy. So there were many that from the beginning, knowing neither why or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but onely ſhewing a hatred to the innocent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and believing that in ſo doing they ſtrucke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humor of the Court, and were thereby like to preferre themſelves as many have done that have founded their fortunes upon that only foundation, and ſince have really entred into affections of hatred and malevolence, fomenting them by faining a falſe fame that the father was oppoſit to other prieſts, that in conſultations he went alwaies againſt Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal juriſdiction, and this is at this day the very center where all their lines doe collineate. A meer falſhood and well knowne to them that governe which they being able to carry no further, muſt now teſtifie to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98082:73"/>the glory of God, whether he ſerved for a bridle or for a ſpurre according to the urgency of occaſions, &amp; the good offices which he continued to doe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Clergie; and whether he were not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall advocate for the Juriſdiction and libertie of the Church. <q>
                  <hi>I meane the true Canonicall and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Church, but not that which is now uſurpt and employed to the ſubſerſion of publique governments and of religion it ſelfe. Becauſe the father alwaies offir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a moſt intenſe zeale, that nothing gave ſo great an impediment to the progreſse of the Catholique religion as when they extended their libertie into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and that this alone had cauſed and maintained ſo deplorable a diviſion in religion,</hi>
               </q> and ſome have been very injurious to calumniate him, that either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation or in his writings he went about to beare downe the juriſdiction of the Church, and to exalt more then was neceſſary, the power of ſecular Princes.</p>
            <p>It is true that with a frequent zeale of the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of holie Church and religion he was moved to blame Princes as guilty of a great ſinne, for not caring to preſerve that juriſdiction and power that God had granted them, upon which ſubject he hath written much, and grounded it upon piety and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable truth. Becauſe authoritie is given by God to Princes, not for themſelves but for the benefit of the people, the Prince being but the depoſitary, the Cuſtos and executor, not the Patrone of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to change or leſſen it at his pleaſure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tis a groſſe ignorance and a moſt wretched ſinne not to keepe up, that which God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon them. And Princes are not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98082:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>guilty of a great ſin &amp; offence before God then out of an ignorant zeale to have ſuffered ſo great a part of their power to be uſurped, and that they are no longer able to rule the people committed to their charge without continuing a change of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The negligences of Princes in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hath beene pernitious to the Church of God; and to all Eccleſiaſtique order. And whoſoever ſhall without paſſion conſider how far the father was any way a breeder of controverſies that have beene in the Church, ſhall finde how he hath deplored them to be the true originall of all thoſe miſchiefes, which have now brought into the Church the moſt poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike mundane government that ever was: and buſied the Eccleſiaſtiques in things not onely different, but alſo contrary to the inſtituted miniſtery of Chriſt, keeping Chriſtendome in perpetuall diſcord. And the diviſions at this day, that are among Chriſtians ſo irrevocable by any other meanes then the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and miraculous hand of God. He held it for certaine that they were bred not ſo much by obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in diverſitie of opinions, and contrariety of doctrine, as from the ſtrife about juriſdiction which after by degeneration, and growing into factions hath taken up the maske of religion. And as one well verſt in hiſtories hath obſerved, that good Princes from time to time have beene they, that have kept their juriſdiction moſt entire. But effeminate ignorant &amp; vitious Princes are they, that have loſt a great part or by their inſufficiency ſuffered others to uſurpe it, with ſuch a deformation in the Church, and for a prooſe of this, it is not neceſſary to runne backe to the examples of the <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſio's,</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98082:74"/>the <hi>Juſtinians,</hi> whoſe Lawes &amp; Codexes who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will reade ſhall finde this to be verified, but to thoſe that are nearer our owne age, and to thoſe whom the Roman Church this day acknowledgeth to be even the baſis of their temporall greatneſſe. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, and other catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique kings.</p>
            <p>But this malevolence hath not beene unfruitfull to all ſorts of men, for as it hath beene helpfull to ſome, ſo it hath beene hurtfull to others, becauſe in the fathers life, and (which is more to be wondered at) after his death, it hath befriended many religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, not onely of the order of the <hi>Servi,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the obtaining of degrees, and good offices, alwaies giving the foile to their concurrents, by ſaying no more but that they were affectionate, or that they had but treated with the father, and by this meanes they have ſupplanted thoſe perſons, that never ſpoke with nor ever ſaw the father even ſo farr as to be laught at by thoſe that have knowne the truth of particulars, eſpecially after his death: as of <hi>Alberto Teſtoni</hi> whom wee named before, who to obtaine a prelacy from Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane</hi> by way of briefe, (which was againſt the law,) uſed this as a meanes. That it having beene formerly collated at a Chapter, it had belonged to a dependent of father <hi>Pauls,</hi> who had beene dead two yeares before. And another to exempt himſelfe from the command of his provinciall, wrote that he had beene a diſciple of maſter <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom the man had never ſpoken at any time, and another obtained a very faire abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for having brought whores to live with him in his Cell. for wearing piſtolls and other things of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98082:75"/>that nature upon confeſſion and conviction, and by his oenly excuſe that he had beene in diſgrace with the father, but all theſe are ridiculous levities.</p>
            <p>Returning to things that are more ſerious. This hatred thus nouriſht, brought to light a new machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the life of the father in the yeare 1609. In the time that the Cardinall <hi>Borgheſe</hi> (and before his uncle had aſcended to the pontificate) ſtudied at <hi>Perugia. Fra. Bernardo Perugino</hi> infinuated himſelfe into his grace and friendſhip, and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine youthfull ſervices, which he performed to the Cardinall, he being but a young man himſelfe, and one that did not abhor the ordinarie guſtoes of his age. He grew into ſuch intimacy with him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after made a Cardinall, he called him after him to <hi>Rome</hi> there to make him amends for the pleaſure and ſervice that he had done him. Whether the Frier invited himſelfe, or were invited, goes beyond my knowledge.</p>
            <p>True it is, that he treated with, and inſtructed a Frier of <hi>Perugia Gio: Franceſco</hi> ſending him to <hi>

                  </gap>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> from the Generall of the <hi>Servi,</hi> under pretence of being a ſtudent where he was after made a doctor although with very little learning. This man by the vicinity of <hi>Padua</hi> come oft to <hi>Venice</hi> to the houſe of the <hi>Servi,</hi> where he frequented much with <hi>Fra.

The privacy was eaſily obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned becauſe they were both of one ſtate &amp; province, and had beene formerly acquainted in their country. This practiſe began to diſpleaſe the father, but his modeſtie was ſuch that he did but caſt out a word of diſlike in generall termes only to <hi>Fra. Antonio,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:98082:75"/>who in appearance ſeemed thereupon a little to withdraw himſelfe from that converſation, but in exiſtence and really they had private meetings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without the convent, whereupon the ſaid <hi>Gio Franceſco</hi> was forbidden to come there any more. And yet notwithſtanding they wrote one to another, and the letters were brought to <hi>Fra Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> by the hands of a Jew. It fortun'd that the Jew brought a letter when <hi>Fra. Antonio</hi> was from home, and the letter came to the hands of <hi>Padre Gio Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Segnira,</hi> who having received it, carried it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to the father, and telling him that the Hebrew had confeſt to him that it was uſuall for him to carry letters betwixt them. And as that nation of the Jewes is very cunning, and timerous he told him, that for his part he would de clare himſelfe to <hi>Fra. Antonio,</hi> that he ſhould make him carry no more letters, becauſe he knew not what the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was, that was ſo ſecret betwixt them. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſed <hi>Fra.

He excuſed himſelfe the beſt he could, and paſt it over with a jeſt, (which he was very good at) and for which he was eſteemed good company, being reputed rather ſimple then malitious, and that all the reaſon of his practiſe with him (as he ſaid) was onely to get a good dinner out of him. But although he was forbidden this commerce, yet it was not ſo cut off, but he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it more covertly, in the houſe of a certain gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and in unſuſpected places untill the bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſineſſe grew ripe.</p>

Becauſe one morning about breake of day they had a meeting and ſecret conference in the veſtry of the Servi, where having beene a good while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and obſerv'd that at their parting they were very earneſt <hi>Fra. Gio Franceſco</hi> pul'd out of the poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of his hoſe a bundle of ſoft waxe lapt in paper to take the print of ſome keyes that were to bee fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, which being heated with lying neare his fleſh, drew out with it from his pocket a little packet of letters, which for the weight, the waxe not being able to keepe ſticking, fell to the ground (being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiv'd,) And when <hi>Fra. Antonio</hi> had receiv'd the waxe, they parted, he to the Convent, and the other as his way lay. The Sacriſtan that kept the Veſtry <hi>Fra. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentine da venetia</hi> (who yet ſerves in that place) comming and finding the bundle of letters, tooke them up, and went with them preſently to <hi>Padre Fulgentio,</hi> who reading them, found them to be in ciphers, &amp; that it was a buſineſſe of much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, becauſe <hi>Fra. Bernardo</hi> had written to <hi>Fra. Gio Franceſco</hi> to ſolicite <hi>Fran. Antonio</hi> to diſpatch the Quadrageſimale, for that the foure hundred crownes were in a readineſſe, and ſhould be put into his hands, but that the twelve thouſand alſo and more were as ready and ſecure.</p>
            <p>In ſome of them he ſaid that he had ſpoken with the <hi>Signor Padre,</hi> and another while Col. <hi>Fratello</hi> with the little Fryer and with divers others, and that they did all of them deſire the Quadrageſimall, That the father Generall of the Servi intreated him not to doubt, but that he ſhould be beatified. That the <hi>Seignor Padre</hi> had cauſed all other Suitors, to withdraw to give him audience, with many ſuch
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98082:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>particularities, which being made knowne to <hi>Father Paul,</hi> you neede not doubt but he would quickly penetrate the importance of the buſineſſe, but ſuch was his meekeneſſe and manſuetude of minde, that hee exhorted <hi>Fulgentio</hi> to make no words, but to keepe ſilence untill the ſecret of this buſineſſe, might more clearely be diſcovered, onely he added thus much, that there was nothing more to be done, but to put <hi>Fra. Antonio</hi> out of his chamber and out of the Convent. But <hi>Fulgentio</hi> was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſolved, who without more adoe carried the letters to the inquiſitors of ſtate, telling them how he came by them, whereupon <hi>Fra. Giova. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco</hi> was attached and firſt, then <hi>Fra. Antonio,</hi> and what enſued further in that ſecret judgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in their owne papers: The things that came after to publike notice, (and they are very true,) that of many perſons that were named in that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of Father, little Frier and Coſens, It appeared upon the counter cipher that except the Generall of the <hi>Servi,</hi> there was not any under the degree, and dignity of a Cardinall. That under the Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimale, there were three perſons enciphred; The firſt was, that becauſe the Father, by reaſon of the falling of the gut Colon (whereof mention hath beene made) had neede to keepe that part very faire and cleane, being every eight dayes waſh't and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to which Office he would never admit Barbers nor ſecular men, and of himſelfe being not able to doe it, he made uſe of ſome Frier the moſt dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, and confident that he could finde. And this charitie at this time was perform'd him by the ſaid <hi>Fra. Antonio,</hi> and to that purpoſe hee was treated
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98082:77"/>with, that when he ſerved him upon that occaſion, he ſhould give him a cutt with his raſor with a ſure way.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fra. Antonio</hi> refuſed ſo to doe, either becauſe he had no intention to offend the Father that was his moſt bountifull benefactor, or elſe as he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd himſelfe both by words and letters ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> that his heart did not ſerve him, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that ſo ſoone as he ſhould ſee blood hee ſhould fall into a ſwound, as by nature it uſed alwaies to be with him. The ſecond was that ſomething ſhould be ſent him from <hi>Rome,</hi> to be given him either in his meate or his drinke, and this better fitted his fancy to be done, becauſe with one beane (ſuch was their language he might catch two pigeons, which were the <hi>Father Paul</hi> and <hi>Fra. Fulgentio.</hi> But this partie carried along with it many difficulties. Firſt, how to finde a thing of ſuch efficacy, and how it might be ſent with ſafety: Then becauſe the Fathers diet was of ordinary meates, ſimple and without ſauce, and ſuch as were common with all thoſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, whereby it was neceſſary, that above thirty other perſons ſhould partake of the vertue of that drugge aſwell as they, or elſe it would faile of effect, ſince it was now come to paſſe that every thing would be narrowly lookt into, and that they had an eye upon every one that came neare him: And he that ſhould watch a tyme when they two would eate by themſelves, would have a long buſineſſe, and this ſtood not with that expedition which was preſt by the letters for the having of the Quadrageſimales. There were likewiſe ſome that are alive ſuſpected upon a late accident, that they two having eaten a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98082:77"/>little quantitie of a cake that was preſented to them at the table, they found themſelves both very ill upon it, and with the ſame accidents, whereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was growne verie quick ſighted. The third (whereon they ſet up their reſt) was that <hi>Fra. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>) which ſeemed a thing without difficulty) ſhould take the print of the keies of the fathers chamber in waxe, and thereupon make falſe keies, and to this purpoſe the waxe that had beene prepared was to ſerve (as twas ſaid before) the plot being, that as <hi>Gio Franceſco</hi> had thoſe keyes at his command, they ſhould ſecretly bring into the monaſtery two or more murtherers, and by night to murther the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent father.</p>
            <p>But God was pleaſed to diſcover this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, as you have formerly heard. And becauſe he that was guilty was a perſon of as much cunning as could be found out, for ſuch a purpoſe, and had prepar'd his expoſitions upon all that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, which not being ſufficient to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the mindes of the judges, nor they able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him ſo cleerly as they deſired. The moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent councell often deſired extreamly to ſee the bottome of this practiſe, and all the diſtinct parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities whereupon they grew to give a ſentence that <hi>Fra. Gio Franceſco</hi> ſhould be hanged by the throate, but with this alternative, that if within certaine prefixt daies he ſhould diſcover the whole practiſe with a full expoſition and juſtification of the letters, that then after a yeares impriſonment he ſhould be under a perpetuall baniſhment from the moſt ſerene dominions with capitall puniſhment in caſe of contravention. Whereupon he deſired that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98082:78"/>a publique miniſter might be ſent to his chamber in <hi>Padova;</hi> where in a ſecret cabinet there were letters found in great number, with Ciphers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciphers, whereby all that you have formerly heard was cleerly juſtified, and ſome thing elſe which was not publiſhed, nor ever came to any knowledge in particular. The piety of this government being ſuch and ſo great, that they thought fit to conceale, whatſoever gave no hinderance to the execution of their moſt milde Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But for all the gravity of the injury the father never forgot his gentle nature, but beſought and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned many times upon his knees, demanding this as a favour in recompence of his beſt ſervices which he had ever done to the publique, that for his ſake they ſhould not be made ſpectacles to the diſhonour of his religion, inwardly and cordially grieving himſelfe that his life ſhould be the ruine of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And it was believed that his inſtances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties were a great part of the cauſe of the ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative. Thus this tedious buſineſſe came to an end, which hath produced many ſtrange effects. In the Church-men a moſt ſharpe hatred and blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it tooke no effect, in the republique a moſt intenſe deſire of the conſervation of their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and in the univerſall a more glorious fame to ſee (beſide other excellent qualities) ſo ſingular a favour, and divine protection.</p>
            <p>But beſides the aforeſaid attempts of trechery brought into juſtice, the father hath beene adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of many others from time to time in following yeares, (not onely in private from ſuch as were in fee for diſcovery) but from thoſe perſons that were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98082:78"/>intereſted in that ſtate and government where ſuch ſecrets paſt. And among theſe one was of a bargaine that was made to take him alive, and with a barcke prepared for the purpoſe to carry him into anothrs juriſdiction. But he never appearing but in the greateſt frequence of the City, or becauſe it begunne to be knowne that the Popes minde was mitigated towards him, and therefore it would not be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a ſervice as formerly it had beene. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that for theſe reaſons the plot was not attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>There happened to come about this time to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> a young man habited like a ſouldier, but in his carriage and in his cloathing more then in his ſword and dagger he ſeemed to be a Religious. He uſed all the meanes he could to ſpeake with the father, who by ſo many publique admonitions was now brought to ſuffer none to ſpeake with him, except he were firſt knowne by his name and ſurname, by his countrey and profeſſion, or elſe brought in by ſome noble, and neere friend. By reaſon whereof he he could have no acceſſe unto him. But addreſſing himſelfe to <hi>Fra. Fulgentio</hi> he uſed all the arte he could to be brought in by his meanes affirming that he had ſomething to ſay to the father of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which would be very well worth his knowing, and that if he might ſpeake with him, he would lay downe his armes and ſubmit himſelfe to any ſtrictneſſe the father would impoſe upon him. But the father excuſing himſelfe, that although he he was not much in love with his life, yet after ſo many faire warnings, it would be aſcribed too great imprudence if any inſtructed man ſhould have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98082:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>him, as it hath beene lately ſeene in the caſe of a great Prince, wherefore the young mans great importunitie to ſpeake with him was ſo much the more ſuſpected, and the waies that he tooke did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him more being (as it was believed) a religious man of the moderne order or at leaſt one of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, And therefore he would never conſent to heare him. But being ſtill inſtant with the father <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio</hi> with whom he thought he had bred a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he told him that he was a neare kinſman to Cardinal <hi>Baromus,</hi> though fallen into disfavour with him, and that he would adviſe him ſomething, that concern'd his life, whereof he would give him ſuch inſtances as might aſſure him of the truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was further reſolv'd that he ſhould not heare him, and then the father ſpoke it with ſome little paſſion, that it was a leſſe trouble to die, a violent death then to be put into a neceſſitie of living in continuall feares, becauſe miſchiefes have their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, but feares go in infinite. So being able to get nothing but an exhibition from <hi>Fulgentio</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his need) he reſolved to deſiſt in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and looking upon him, when he parted with a fixt looke, he ſaid thus, <hi>Guardatevi da traditori, guard your ſelves from traitors, for you have very great neede; God preſerve you for you are honeſter religious men then others would you were.</hi> And having made another attempt (but in vaine) to ſpeake with the father upon the ſtayres of the pallace, he went his waies, and was ſeene no more.</p>
            <p>One other particular to the like purpoſe muſt not be ſilenc't. The Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with whom the father had ſome accquaintance (as hath beene
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98082:79"/>ſaid) and although their writings one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were abroade in print: yet that good affection whoſe roote is from vertue and chriſtian Charitie was not extinct neither in the one nor the other. He ſent twice to him to preſent him with ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love once by a Roman Secular, who told him from the Cardinall that he wiſht him to looke carefully to himſelfe, for that he had great cauſe. And by another time when <hi>Alberto Teſtini</hi> was come from <hi>Rome</hi> to a Chapter at <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Cardinall impos'd it upon him, that going to <hi>Venice,</hi> he ſhould ſalute the father in his name with much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to aſſure him that his love to him was not abated at all, And by this he deſired him to take an aſſurance that a Frier of <hi>Vicenza</hi> naming one <hi>Fra. Felice</hi> (that lives) had under the title of the life of father <hi>Paul</hi> compos'd a famous libell and made it to be preſented to the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, who had delivered it to him (the Cardinall) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and to give him his opinion, whether it were fit to be publiſhed, and that he the Cardinall made this relation, that he knew the father very well, and that his holineſſe might take his word, that the things mentioned were notorious calumnies, which would be diſhonorable to whoſoever ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them. Thus much <hi>Maeſtro Alberto Teſtoni</hi> told the father beſides ſome other things. In offences of all ſorts both againſt his life and his honnour (the calumnies which have bene put in printe againſt him, being infinite) which ſuch a member of libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers thinking to pleaſe the humour of the Court written) and it hath ſo farre exeeded the limits of all Chriſtian profeſſion, that like a ſwarme of frogs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98082:80"/>in a muddy marſh, they have taken that embleme from their ſhameleſneſſe, only to ſee how farre their malediction could be carried, yet the father never ſhewed the leaſt ſigne either of diſdaine, or revenge, one of his moſt excellent vertues which hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to his grave, was his meekeneſſe in ſuch a perfection, that thoſe of his religion with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall voice render him this teſtimony, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew him endeavour any the leaſt kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and it is to be obſerved, that the authour of that famous libell whereof we made mention, was not <hi>Fra. Felice</hi> of <hi>Vincenza</hi> as it was reported, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other whom for his diſcredit I ſpare to name, and one whom the father might well have procur'd to be puniſhed at his pleaſure. But hee would not onely not doe it, but as long as the father lived, that man lived in ſecurity, with imployments of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but the father was no ſooner dead, but that injury being reſented by the publique, with other failings and wretched operations of his, brought him ſo farre into the publique indignation that hee was not ſuffered to remaine in the Dominions of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice.</hi> Philoſophie and the very law of Chriſt can verie hardly eradicate a certaine pleaſant itch of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and it is no ſmall matter to abſtaine from the action.</p>
            <p>But this Father of ours, was arrived at ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vertue, that when hee received the greateſt wrong, he kept the ſame ſerenity of face, mildneſſe of language, extenuating the injuries that were done him as much as twas poſſible to doe, alledging this many times for a reaſon; That ſuch an one either had his braines crackt, or that his condition hung
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98082:80"/>upon ſuch intereſts, that he could doe no otherwiſe, after this time the Popes minde ſeemed to be much mitigated, and he was ſomewhat ſincerd in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Fathers goodneſſe and pietie.</p>
            <p>True it is that the Biſhop of <hi>Tine</hi> being not long after called to <hi>Venice</hi> upon a proceſſe form'd againſt him by inquiſitors of theirs, that were ſent into the <hi>Levant.</hi> His cauſe was committed to the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the father <hi>Paul</hi> who made ſuch a judgement and relation upon it, that the Biſhop was rather commended, then reprehended by the publique, obtaining divers priviledges for his Church, and for his perſon, and returning afterwards from <hi>Rome,</hi> and comming to <hi>Venice,</hi> he told the Father that the Pope had enquired diſtinctly of his ſucceſſe in his buſineſſe, and underſtanding how the Father had comported himſelfe, he ſeem'd to be much pleas'd, and broke into ſome expreſſions, that from divers parts he had heard that the Father was a great friend to juſtice, and carried himſelfe with much prudence and ſincerity: And of the other ſide, the Father pray'd and deſir'd God to ſend the Pope a long life, and that he might ſurvive him, as hee was younger then he by a yeare or thereabouts, and hee would often ſay to ſome of his inward friends by way of prognoſtique that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> he beleeved had ſha'kt off his ill affection towards him, but if he were dead, whoſoever ſhould ſucceede him, would revive it a gaine, becauſe the effects of the paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverfie continued ſtill like ſcarres, which in ſome ſome ſort or other would quickly come into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and he was not at all deceived in his judgement, (as will hereafter appeare:) But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98082:81"/>withſtanding this malevolence, it was a thing more then certaine, that even at <hi>Rome</hi> among the great prelates, he had a mighty repute, and that when they had occaſion to ſpeake of him though but to ſatisfie the Court, and their owne intereſts, yet they diſcovered that they had him in opinion of a great perſonage, both for honeſtie and learning, and it is alſo certaine that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> found much fault in publique, that ſo little reckoning was made of a man of ſuch eminent parts, and ſaid, that if he could have beene reconcil'd to the ſervice of the Church, although they had given him but a dry flower to ſmell on (for thoſe were his very words,) conceiving that the father had formerly beene deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtaſted of the Court becauſe Pope <hi>Clement</hi> had twice refuſed to give him a ſmall Biſhopricke, the one of <hi>Melopotamo,</hi> and the other of <hi>Nona</hi> in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia:</hi> and he ſpoke it freely that he had alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have him live at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he had knowne him, and practiſed him, and knew very well how greate ſervice hee was able to have done the Church. The Signor Cardinall <hi>Forza</hi> beeing a Prince of ſuch a ſublimity of vertue and blood as tis well knowne might beleev'd to have had the baſeneſſe of flatterers in abhorment; who to feede the humour of the Court proſtitute their tongues (making them venale) to lying and calumnies) this Cardinall would often with much delight tempt another father <hi>Fra. Amante Buonvicino</hi> that was at <hi>Rome (Parochian</hi> of <hi>Santa maria in via</hi>) and went under the name of a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enetian,</hi> and put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcourſe concerning Father <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeming to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him in it, wherewith that Father finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98082:81"/>to be too farre urged, would enter into a narrative of the Fathers life, of his Studies, of the poverty wherein he lived, with all the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which he was both wiſe and cunning, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how much the Cardinall was pleaſed with it, becauſe when hee came to give demonſtrations of his excellent piety, he would anſwer him with a ſmile, &amp; ſay that thoſe perhaps were but hypocriſies to coſen the world, but hee ſpoke it after ſuch a manner that the Frier might well perceive it was ſpoken but in a way of upbraiding, or giving the lie to ſuch as thought ſo of him, and thereupon he freely gave him the ſame reply which the Signior <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illiers</hi> now Ambaſſadour to the moſt Chriſtian King, had done to two <hi>Nuntios Zachia</hi> at preſent, and <hi>Aſcoli</hi> that was before him, who being often conſtrained in poynt of Argument by the too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torioues truth of the innocent and exemplarie life of the father, would alwaies ſpit their venome, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was an Hypocrite, whereunto the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illers</hi> made them this reply: That the Fathers courſe was quite contrary to that of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, becauſe they make all their actions to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare clothed with piety in publique as much as they can poſſibly, although they can never goe ſo conceal'd but that they make a diſcovery of their ends to be but avarice, ambition, and temporall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, inſomuch that the skinne of the lambe could never quite cover nor conceale that of the wolfe: But the Father never made any ſuch ſhew to the publique, but lived in an abſolute retirednes. He was never knowne to uſe any hypocriticall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to hold out crownes in his hand as he went
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98082:82"/>through the ſtreets, not to kiſſe medailles, not to affect ſtations and places at times of concourſe, not to ſpeake with affected Spiritualities, nor to uſe ſordidneſſe in his garments, but onely a cleanlineſſe of attire, which though poore was yet condecent. And if this bee called Hypocriſie it is an unknowne ſort of hypocriſie, which hath neither objectnor end, nor ſo much as a circumſtance of either.</p>
            <p>The dialogue betweene the <hi>Nuntio Zachia</hi> and <hi>Villiers</hi> was occaſioned in this manner Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Villiers</hi> is a Gentleman of great ſinceritie, and of a moſt ingenious heart, but not very capeable of the artificies, eſpecially of the Courtiers of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are the moſt refined of the world. <hi>Pietro A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſileneo</hi> a frenchman was the Phyſitian to his houſe, who was the very ſincerity and goodneſſe of nature; and having beene a great friend to the father, now by the ſpace of forty yeares, hee made it knowne to him, how every time the Nuntios talked with the Ambaſſadour concerning the Father, They ſpoke alwaies of him with ſuch prefaces of honour, as if they would make him to be one of the moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in the world; at this the Father laugh't and would ſometimes ſay, ſo it is fit, and ſo it ſhould be, becauſe I am the moſt divers and differing from their humour that's poſſible: And if they bee the moſt perfect and holy men, then I am the moſt lewd and wretched man that can bee ſpoken of. But he ſaid yet further deſiring to bee ſatisfied how the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life ſeem'd ſo ſcandalous to deſerve ſuch Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies from Churchmen, and that hee knew not what to doe to give ſatisfaction to thoſe great prelates, nor what to abſtaine from to take away their ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98082:82"/>opinions, onely he wiſht that the next time the Nuntio ſpoke of him to the Ambaſſador, he would interrupt him a little, to know what was his reaſon to charge him with ſuch hypocriſie. His friend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Ambaſſador of this diſcourſe who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his opportunitie which happened to be the 16 of <hi>February</hi> 1621. when the Nuntio entred into his uſuall cuſtome of railing upon the father. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador replied upon him, that from all other men he had alwaies heard the father to be much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his goodneſſe and integrity, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſaid he would be very glad to know from him, what ground he had for the contrary, that he might the better know how to believe thoſe that informed him otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Nuntio was ſuddainly ſurpriſed, with this demand of his, and durſt not deny what the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had ſaid, becauſe it was too well knowne, but deſired to disengage himſelfe, by charging his good actions and his innocent life with hypocrifie. But this foild him ſo much the more, becauſe the Ambaſſador preſt him againe to know what end he had diſcovered in the father, or what external action to prove him an hypocrite. To this the Nuntio knew not what to ſay, but was defirous to divert the diſcourſe to ſome other ſubject.</p>
            <p>But becauſe all things tooke eaſie impreſſion with the father, eſpecially things of weight, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after a little merriment and facetious diſcourſe conjur'd an inward friend of his to deale plainely with him and to adviſe him of his defects, and in particular if according to the rules of holy Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall doctrine he found in him any arguments
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98082:83"/>of hypocrifie, acknowledging that a man is not better knowne to any, nor yet more concealed from any then himſelfe, and that the nature of ſelfe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not eaſily rooted out. Such dialogiſmes as theſe paſt betwixt them a little after thoſe times of the late co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions in <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; alſo at the Court of the moſt Chriſtian King, betwixt the Ambaſſador <hi>Pietre Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarini</hi> and the Cardinall <hi>Vbaldini,</hi> at that time Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio in that Court, This Cardinall did allwaies uſe to infamize the father for his publiſht writings with odious appellations. <hi>Contarini</hi> on the other ſide, a gentleman of ſingular candour, of a placid nature, ſweete and nothing contentious, but yet ſolide, made him this anſwer, that he himſelfe was neither a divine nor yet a doctor of the lawes to maintaine a difference with his moſt reverend Lordſhip, but concerning the fathers writings he was well aſſured, that they were neither ſo ignorant nor ſo impious as the Nuntio had made them, which was eaſily by ſo great a commendation wherewith they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in all the Catholique ſtates, by the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pious profeſſors of ſciences, but concerning his life and manners, he was very certaine and knew it, not onely by relation by experience, that he was irreprehenſible, and that he lived an holy retind and exemplary life. To which the Nuntio <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldini</hi> made anſwer, that by ſo much he confirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more in his opinion that he was a lewd fellow and an exquifite hypocrite from his irreprehenfible life; But <hi>Maffeo Barbarino</hi> that was the Nuntio in <hi>France</hi> talkt in a higher ſtraine againſt him and with more violence cried out with poeticall am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications that he was worſe then <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98082:83"/>and contained not himſelfe from ſaying that it was fit he ſhould bee aſſeſſinated. There he came to know that the father wrote to and received letters from ſome of thoſe Lords that were councellors of Parliament, and from the Sorboniſts who were very orthodoxe, and maintained the defence of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſecular power, oppoſing themſelves againſt the uſurpations of <hi>Rome,</hi> and maintayning the libertie of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>And true it is, that he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> write to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive letters from <hi>Monſieur Gillet Peſchaſier Servino Richer Buniello,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Cauſabon</hi> after the fame was growne conſtant, that he was turn'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. The letters were alwaies conſulted by the juriſdiction. All men were heretiques with <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> to whom the father either wrote, or they to him. But they that knew not how to convince him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his profeſſion or in his life, had that onely common place againſt him that he was an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. A faire confrontation of the judgement of theſe prelates of the Romane Court with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt and his Holy Apoſtles, who taught us to know mens faith by their works, and the tree by the fruit. And if a life led with a marvelous even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conſtancy from his childhood unto ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie one yeares old, which for his actions none could taxe, and in whoſe words was never either obſcaenitie, nor ſo much as an oathe ſworne, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baſe thing but in his life a moſt exquiſite pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, a perfect obſervance of lawes, far from all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and above all he was an enemy to all delights, nor ever ſhewed the leaſt ſigne of avarice nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of any degree or dignitie: And if theſe be th
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98082:84"/>arguments whereby Chriſt hath taught us to know Hypocrites, let it be referred to the judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. But neither God nor humanitie will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit innocency to have ſo ill a fortune, nor vertue ſuch a miſadventure that fame and infamie ſhould allwaies be at the diſpoſition of great perſons. The juſt man is like a palme tree, who raiſeth himſelfe under the burden of Calumnie. God was never plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that thoſe verie tyrants that had a totall licence againſt the life of poore innocents; ſhould likewiſe have any power over their fame and memory. And if this were but in humanitie it ſelfe (without a mixture of any vertue) it would lye under too great an injuſtice. But becauſe this marke (whereat all their poiſoned arrowes were ſhot) could never be hit: his contempt of money being ſo well knowne, and that he had nothing but to ſuffice his pure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and thoſe rather in defect then plenty, much leſſe delicates of every kinde (whereof he was alwaies abhorring) even ſo far that to the laſt breath of his life he hath conſtantly beene obſerved never to have any other guſto then that which tooke his originall, and was terminated in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and in vertue, and therefore his life was the moſt arduous, the moſt toileſome and painefull that any religious man was able leade; he being in his laſt ſeaventeene yeares like a recluſe alwaies ſhut up in his chamber, except it were when the publique ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or his religious profeſſion compelled him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and to live ſo ſparing and ſo abſtinently, and according to pure neceſſity, that the greateſt part of his time was paſt with a little bread toſted upon hot coles, and onely one ſort of other foode
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98082:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>to his bread, which was both vile in quantity &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity This was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>one to advance his kindred (for of thoſe there were none left) but this ambition and appetite of glory (which among human affections is the laſt which is ſubdued) and the wiſe man calls it the ſhirt which the wiſeſt men ever put off laſt. This is that putrid corruption whereupon all theſe fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies fluttering up and downe the world, doe at laſt ſettle themſelves. But againſt the aſſaults of this vice, he had an impenetrable ſhield, in ſo much as if ever man had totally ſubdued this affection of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of glory, it was this man of whom wee write.</p>
            <p>And firſt, for a certaine proofe that no advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fortune nor any credit in the world, had moved him to any mutation of minde, ſo far as could be concluded from externall effects, (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies in the ſame, and his owne tenor of life, to which purpoſe he had alwaies this ſaying in his mouth, <hi>ſi Spiritus dominantis ſuper te aſcenderit, Locum tuum ne deſeras;</hi> and in a way of reſt he was used to ſay. That he that walks upon ſtilts, or fits in an high place, does not leſſen his labour, but goes in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger. Beſides that conſtant purpoſe of never writing, nor publiſhing any thing in any kinde of profeſſion (being in all things eminent) and as I may ſay prodigiouſly perfect; ſhewes whether he were far from any ſuch deſire, and whether it could be done with any vaine glory or no.</p>
            <p>Theſe few things which neceſſitie hath drawne from him can well witneſſe. He hath beene curious to conceale himſelfe for being knowne to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of divers ſort of inrſtuments. The two manners
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98082:85"/>of <hi>Pulfiligio</hi> were of his invention, the inſtrument of knowing the variation of heate and cold, of that perſpective which in <hi>Italy</hi> is called <hi>Galilean,</hi> and form'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> the artifice of it was diſcovered by him; when one of them was firſt preſented to the Signory of <hi>Venice,</hi> with a demande of 1000 Chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines the charge was preſently given to the father to make a triall what it would ſerve for, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his judgment, and being not allowed to open it, to ſee how it was made up, he imagined ſtraight what it could be, and conferred with the <hi>Gallilean</hi> who acknowledged that the father had found out the ſecret, and ſo of divers others. But it is a thing to be obſerved, that ſo many inſtruments as have been invented by the authors of the Mathematiques and of Aſtronomy, and deſcribed with ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, that it is a difficult thing to make them, and much more to make uſe of them. He making them with his owne hand, and giving out modells to workmen, reduced them to ſuch a facility and fimpleneſſe that one would have thought he had had both the heavens and earth in his head. It hath beene a grat prejudice to thoſe that are curious, that in the probleme of the motion of the earth being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient but renewed by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> he had found the meanes <hi>Salvare tutti i Fenomeni</hi> with one onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſought workmen to make him an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put under ones eyes, for the diſcerning of it. I ſilence thoſe ſecrets which were unknowne untill his age, and he was ever well pleaſed, that ſome of his friends ſhould have the honor to publiſh them, as if they had beene their owne; which ſhewes a great moderation in this affection of his. And of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98082:85"/>things of his that are in print, what glory hath he ſought by thoſe, having uſed ſuch exquiſite meanes to conceale his name: One particular muſt not be paſt over, which was a firme reſolution of leaving nothing, either of his own hand, or other mens that might carry his name or preſerve a memory as may appeare by this that he would never let his picture be drawn from the naturall, notwithſtanding that it were deſired both by kings and great Princes. And although many of his pictures goe abroad for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls, yet they are all but coppies of one which is ſaid to be in the gallery of a great King, which was taken againſt his will and by a ſtratagem.</p>
            <p>But for himſelfe this may give aſſurance that he did not endure to have his picture drawne, becauſe in the laſt yeares of his life being intreated by the moſt illuſtrious and excellent <hi>Dominico Molini,</hi> and likewiſe of his confident <hi>Fra. Fulgentio</hi> being ſet on to beſeech him, yet it could not be obtained, ſo much as to give a famous painter leave to take his picture although he were promiſed that he ſhould not ſit at it above an houre. And yet he was ſolicited by this great Lord in the vertue of the friendſhip that had beene betwixt them, and by ſuch ſignificant meanes, that for the deniall which he gave him fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies together whileſt he entertained the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in expectation, he grew ſo angrie with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there paſt ſome monthes betwixt them without ſpeaking to each other. And yet the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Senator, and the eſteeme which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had of him as of a ſubject in whom to be nobly borne was the leaſt of his vertues &amp; merits becauſe of that exquiſite learning which he had in Hiſtories

But the abnorment which he had to live in Court, which he ſhewed firſt in his youth when he left that Court of <hi>Mantua</hi> and in his virility that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having conſtantly refuſed to goe thither upon the invitation of ſo great perſons, and ſuch opportunities ſhall eaſily convince the moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, that at leaſt they ſhould not dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Chriſt ſo-openly in this ſaying of his that thoſe which weare rich clothing are in Princes Courts, and in theſe daies of ours it is well knowne where ambition hath her chiefeſt ſeate.</p>
            <p>But in Churchmen it is certainely a thing moſt unſeeming and ſcandalous to calumniate ſo rare a piety of Hypocriſie, becauſe to thoſe ends which they propoſe to themſelves, to thoſe apparances
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98082:86"/>which are ſeene in them by that language which they ordinarily ſpeake, they ſhew well enough that they doe but mock the world and very little believe that there is a God, while they pretend their lives ſhould be eſteemed either Apoſtolicall or Chriſtian, and in the mean time condemne the father of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. But the eye of God makes a diſcovery of all hearts, and in the interim this ſhall be received for an irrefragable teſtimony that theſe men which were ſo apt to make a ſiniſter interpretation of all things, being not able to oppoſe his actions, were faine to paſſe to his intentions which are onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and attributed to God by thoſe that believe him to be judge of intention and the ſearcher of hearts.</p>
            <p>This digreſſion cannot be ſuperfluous to them that will conſider the diligence that hath beene uſed to trace the life of this innocent father and to finde imperfections in that faire ſoule for ſome further and hidden ends. But it was not the father that gave them this offence it was his doctrine, and in this matter the Eccleſiaſtiques were greatly guilty of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, before God, and of ſcandall to the world by having given ſo great a cauſe to confirme thoſe in their opinions who write that is <hi>Arcanum Curiae Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae</hi> after it hath drawne to it ſelfe the authority of all Eccleſiaſticke orders, and a great part of that of Princes for the making good in religion of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever turnes to their advantage, to aſſume yet further to themſelves what belongs to the whole Church by canonizing perſons, to canonize thoſe doctrines and opinions of theirs that are profitable to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſo likewiſe to reprove thoſe doctrines
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98082:87"/>which make not to their pretenſions, although they be both true and catholicke, they have uſed from time to time the artificie of calumnitating the the perſons that have written how holy and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſoever they have beene. I doe not deliver this opinion for true, nor doe I conſent to thoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for proofe, but I ſpeake honeſtly, and doe atteſt before God. That in the example of this father of ours, not the Church but the miymons of the Court have uſed this ſtile, and how much worſe they make it, by ſo much they increaſe the ſcandal and irritate Princes, or elſe awaken them to make them ſee, that to calumniate thoſe perſons that ſerve to defend their juſt actions, is to condemne in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity the Princes themſelves and a making the world believe that they can put a yoke of tyrany upon them at their pleaſure by oppreſſing them in life and after death, and conſequently thoſe that were their good and Catholike defendors.</p>
            <p>In the publike ſervice he was ſo daily an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, ſo faithfull, and with ſo much fervour to the good of his Prince, that the moſt ſerence republique honored him with a thing that was never before granted to any of their conſultors, that he might enter into all their archives and records, into their two ſecrets to ſee and manage all their writings and their government, to which honor he hath correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with ſo much fidelitie as they very well know that ſit at the ſterne, and in a ſhort time he grew ſo verſt and knowing, having ſeene whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he could deſire, that he was able by the felicitie of an incomparable memory immediately to lay his hand upon any memoriall, or booke or writing,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98082:87"/>or relation, or whatſoever elſe was deſired or ſought for. He that knowes what is meant by the two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of <hi>Venice</hi> may very eaſily from that alone draw an argument of a divine wit, and of a monſtrous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, becauſe in them there are beſide the publike reaſons of ſtate, the fundamentall lawes, the treaties of war and peace of truces and confederations, and of whatſoever can any waies belong to a great ſtate, there are alſo all the great paſſage of all <hi>Europe</hi> for ſome hundreds of yeares, the changes and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all Chriſtendome, and they are it old books in letters of former ages which, are very hard to reade. And if fire had not twice derived them of a great part of that treaſure, I dare be bold to ſay, it had beene one of the moſt ineſtimable things in the whole world.</p>
            <p>Now this incomparable wit was growne to be ſo much the patrone of thoſe things that at an inſtant he knew the places where to finde, and particulars, in ſo much as his minde was now become the very ſecret place, where without ſearch any one might reade <hi>viva voce</hi> whatſoever was either of neceſſity or curioſity to be knowne. And that this important benefit might not be loſt nor periſh with his life, he hath alſo made ſome indexes with ſo many notes and regiſters, that the uſe of them is now made very eaſie for all times to come. And the importance of his labour herein is found to be ſo uſefull that the that the moſt excellent Senate have ſalaried with an honorable ſtipend the fathers writer, for adjoyning his conſultations to the regiſtry, which happily may riſe to a little leſſe then 1000 tractates and councells all bound up in volumes of perchment.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98082:88"/>And in thoſe treaties either of their confines or their their jurisdiction which might happen during his ſervice, the helps and inſtructions are eaſily found, whereupon the cauſes are founded; whereof I muſt not inſiſt upon particulars, becauſe it concernes the government. But the moſt excellent Senate know very well the conſequence of that ſervice, and what he hath revived out of ignorance upon divers negotiations which happened in his time Becauſe the allegations in law import ſo much, wherein the Republique have alwaies beene ſerved of the moſt able men of <hi>Europe,</hi> and which is yet nothing in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the dilucidation in matter of fact, which is gathered from publike documents which how much it hath imported in the matter of the confines of their ancient dominions of the Golfe, of the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of fees or the precatia of <hi>Ceneda</hi> and <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> hath beene clearly proved in the treaties that followed in his time, by vertue whereof the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtiques were never able to prevaile againſt them in any thing of conſequence, nor were able to finde out any thing which could hold oppoſition againſt the true, reall and fundamentall rights of the moſt ſerene Republique.</p>
            <p>In all this time of the publique ſervice which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeaventeene yeares, I cannot ſay that he was ſubject to more then one infirmitie which was of moment. I finde that he was once in the hand of the Phyſicians in the yeare 1612 which was the firſt time that he referred himſelfe to their cure, except when he was conſtrained by neceſſitie of Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which was onely thrice, once in his youth when riding from <hi>Lombardy</hi> towards <hi>Padova</hi> in the very heate of Summer he was ſupprſſed with a terrible
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98082:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſquinancy, whereupon ſending preſently for a bar bour to take ſome blood from a veine. The barbour refuſed to doe it without order of a Phyſician, and the father not being able to over-rule him, but finding the encreaſe of the inflammation to grow upon him made ſhew of believing him, and agreeing with his opinion, but deſired him that while he went for a Phyſician he would let him ſee whether his Iron were good, and he giving him the caſe, he tooke out his lancet, and preſently ſet it to his owne arme, whereupon the barbor ſeeing his reſolution did his office, and in a few houres as it is uſuall in ſuch accidents, he was free and well. Another time likewiſe in a voiage from <hi>Vicenza</hi> to <hi>Padova</hi> he fell into a ſuppreſſion of Urine, which having not had his courſe for a whole day, he was conſtrained to uſe the help of a ſurgeon by the hand of <hi>Aquapendente</hi> But knowing himſelfe a renicidence to that diſeaſe, he would be provided of a ſurgeon, and candles to operate when neede ſhould require as he did alwaies after with his owne hand. And although <hi>Coll aqua da virgine,</hi> he was ſo eas'd that he ſeldome relaps't into that indiſpoſition, yet for late yeares he hath ſometimes ſuffered, and once among others with ſo much vehemency that making triall as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, and not able to helpe with his owne hand, he held himſelfe to be but a dead man, and immediately with a true tranquility and ſetledneſſe of his minde, he received the ſacrament ſaying, <hi>Queſto é da facere poi ſi penſara al rimanente.</hi> This muſt now be done and after we ſhall thinke of the reſt, but he could not helpe himſelfe as he had done at other times. In the meane time <hi>Fra Fulgentio</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without his knowledge fetcht <hi>Carto Scivo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Lingi Ragoſa</hi> that were famous in that profeſſion, the buſineſſe ended with mirth, for ſo ſoone as they were come to his preſence, &amp; he had had ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the diſeaſe, they deſired him that ſince he had not helpe by his owne hands, that he would give them leave to trie theirs. So riſing up upon his feete without any ſhew of trouble, he ſaid. But muſt I make a triall in your preſence, what will you ſay if I doe it my ſelfe according to art and like a workeman? and immediately he fell to worke with his candle, and ſo the buſineſſe ended being well laught at.</p>
            <p>Yet the father knew very well that age decreaſeth ſtrength and changes the uſe of the very naturall parts and inſtruments. He had alſo another diſeaſe growing in one of his leggs which troubled him for ten monthes, but for that he cut himſelfe with his owne hand many times, and in many places were the apoſteme made, untill it was well healed. A thing very rare in <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in thoſe infirmities that are bred in humors which are occaſioned by agues, he was never in the Phyſicians hand untill the yeare 1612 I know well what it is to depart from common received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of ſpeculation, but much more in operations, eſpecially where it may concerne life, But I have not undertaken to juſtifie, but onely to give a narration of the fathers actions. He was ſo ſubject to feavers, that every little accident cauſed him to have long and ſharpe ones. In which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned himſelfe very differently from the common practiſe. For firſt he would alter nothing of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diet except it were from the more to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98082:89"/>leſſe. He would not keepe his bed, but riſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all his uſuall functions, he read, he ſtudied, he wrote. In the fury of any of his fits being in his cloathes, he would lay himſelfe a long upon a cheſt, or a table but ſeldome in his bed. He ordered the houres of his owne eating, and would have his ordinary allowance as well of wine as other things, except (as I ſaid) from the more to the leſſe, when he ſaw his beſt time he would take Phyſick of his owne appointment, but ſimple, not compounded, as <hi>Caſſia, Manna, Tamaris,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, which either he tooke by themſelves, or elſe being mixt, he received them as he did his other meate, ſo much he was able alwaies to command his affections. He held an opinion, and profeſt it openly, that the way of medication in our time with a ſuddaine and change of diet, and living with ſo many purgations and receipts ſerved for nothing but to make ſlow recoveries, and to hold a diſeaſe in credit, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for men in yeares, to give over their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted actions for many days together did greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improve them in the uſe of the parts of their body, and that for one to betake him to his bed, obſerving ſo ſuddaine and abſolute a mutation of diet and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſe was a neceſſary weakning of a mans ſelfe. And that concerning himſelfe he was ſure that he knew more then any body elſe did or could. And it was truly a rare thing that in ſo weake a complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a convaleſcence could not be more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Many times it could not be judged whether he were ſicke except it were by his aſpect which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him, for otherwiſe he would performe all his accuſtomed actions. And with this tenor of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98082:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>himſelfe he continued to ſixteene yeares of his age, at which time about <hi>July</hi> being in the houſe of <hi>Signor Servilio Treo</hi> upon a weighty conſultation he was ſurpriſed with a violent feaver, that continued with him eighteene daies together, and begun by a ſtrange accident, that it was not poſſible for him neither to take meate nor drinke, but ſo ſoone as it was preſented, his ſtomach abhorred it. In ſo much as he fell into a wonder of himſelfe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to grieve that he was not able to command, and as he ſaid to vanquiſh a falſe opinion, when the fits came upon him in thoſe hot dayes of <hi>July,</hi> as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that they would give him a little cold water, his ſtomake loathed it as ſoone as it was preſented unto him, whereat he would ſometimes laugh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a jeſt at it. It was not poſſible for him to be without the viſits of Phyſicians, becauſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique had commanded them to attend him. It was often in his mouth, <hi>Queſto ho avanzato che mi convie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad altri pui credere ai me cha me mediſimo.</hi> This is all I have gotten that I muſt noſt believe others of my ſelfe more then my ſelf. But he would go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them then often to diſcourſe of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and propoſe ſome medicament, and of many that were propoſed to make choice of ſome one which was propoſed, to him by <hi>Santerio</hi> who had beene his ancient friend, and of a very ſtrickt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>The Phyſicians, and <hi>Santorio</hi> more then others held him a dying man, of which the father <hi>Fulgentio</hi> ſpeaking to him, father <hi>Paul</hi> anſwered him that he was ſecure of his recovery from this ſickneſſe, but if he felt himſelfe worſe that the Phyſicians ſhould
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98082:90"/>heare more of him. <hi>Fulgentio</hi> replyed, bidding him take heed, becauſe he might be deceived, for it was the opinion of <hi>Santerio</hi> that without doubt he ſhould dye of that diſeaſe, ſeeing no amendment in him, and that his ſpirits began to faile, like a plant that beginns to wither, and that he knew the ſolidity of <hi>Santorios</hi> judgment why then (replyed the father) you had beſt believe him, and thereupon he fell a laughing with a witty conceipt which was ſpoken to another purpoſe by <hi>Speron Speroni</hi> who uſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſay <hi>Che ne ſi hoggi.</hi> And after when <hi>Santorio</hi> came to viſite him, he began to jeſt with him, and would not let him feele his pulſe asking him why he would now flatter him after he had peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſentenced him to death. And when he preſcribed him the milke of an aſſe againſt his drineſſe, he ſlighted it facetiouſly by ſaying this is faire coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell indeed from a friend now that I am above 60 yeares of age to make me an alliance with aſſes, &amp; ſo went on ſmiling. And doe you not thinke it a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty relation for me now to become foſter brother to that young aſſe of whoſe milke you would have me uſurpe a part? It was alſo his cuſtome that as in his ſickneſſe he never changed his courſe of life, nor his wonted actions, ſo neither would he change his pleaſant and argute replies, which in in ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered a bodie were a great argument of a full ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureneſſe and entire ſerenity of ſoul. He that was ſo well ſtudied in medicine was able to diſcourſe of it as of his ſimple profeſſion wherein of neceſſity there muſt be a tincture, but in his later yeares he was entred into ſuch a diffidence that he ſeemed to believe no longer in his owne skill of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98082:91"/>what was either good or hurtfull. And whereas formerly he was taxed that ever and anone he took ſome medicament for preſervation of his health, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he would receive none at all upon any condition, except ſome locale medicines, and thoſe upon great neceſſity.</p>
            <p>From his very youth his learning had rendred him famous in all the parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> from whence it happened that ſo many perſons of valew that came to <hi>Venice</hi> (and the condition of that Citty drawes to it from all parts the greateſt ſubjects) tooke great content to looke upon him; and many to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into their bookes which they call <hi>Albus amico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> ſome ſentence of his which is a thing very much in uſe beyond the mountaines, and he uſed to doe it alwaies with ſome notable ancient ſentence or elſe of divine ſcripture. But the occaſion of the interdict a controverſie betwixt two ſo great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> (and wherein by way of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the two Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and all the other potentates of Chriſtendome were entred not onely by notice but by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) made him very famous, &amp; deſired to be ſeene of divers great perſons who made it not the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their peregrinations, and was a cauſe that he was knowne of all the learned men in <hi>Europe,</hi> but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of thoſe that make profeſſion of defending the lawfull authoritie of Princes. He was viſited by letters from the moſt learned that were in <hi>France, Gillot, Leſchaſſier, Salmario, Richer, Boviel Cauſabon,</hi> many Princes have likewiſe honored him with their letters and by the viſits of their ſonnes ſent into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and in what eſteeme he was with them may be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98082:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeene by their letters if it be not thought affection: Onely I may add this, that a great Prince ſending his ſonne into <hi>Italy</hi> put it into his inſtructions that he ſhould not faile to viſite <hi>Orbis terrarum ocellum</hi> giving that title to the father. And when the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of the <hi>Holland</hi> eſtates <hi>Signor Arſeus</hi> came to <hi>Venice,</hi> having uſed all meanes poſſibly to have a ſight of him he was ſatisfied therein, being brought into the Antiſecret to heare the anſwer read that was given him by the moſt excellent Senate to his denialls (as it is the courſe) and having ſeene the father as he croſt the chamber to goe to his place, he ſaid to that Senator that bare him company, the illuſtrio <hi>Signor Guiſtimano,</hi> that he was ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have ſeene that great man the moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all <hi>Europe</hi> that he ſhould be well ſatisfied to returne home againe to his Country, although he had obtained none of his demands from the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and thinke the labour and expenſe of his journey very well beſtowed. I have knowne further alſo by very good information, that he was ſought to, and invited from two crowned heads, if he would have accepted their ſervice in things of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt importance by relation had from their letters to the father delivered by their owne Ambaſſadors then reſident at <hi>Venice.</hi> But he with termes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment due to ſo great Princes refuſed to depart from the ſervice of his naturall ſoveraigne whereunto God had called him.</p>
            <p>Of one of theſe meetings it is neceſſary to make a particular mention. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> 1622 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt yeare of the fathers life but one, come to ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> and deſired by all meanes to have diſcourſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98082:92"/>with the father, who would by no meanes conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to be ſeene of him. But the Prince did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege him in his Monaſtery that he was oft conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſhut himſelfe up in his Cell without ſo much as eating his dinner, becauſe he would not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and all the while the Prince knew him to be within. But at laſt breaking into ſome impatience and laments, that it was a more difficult thing to ſee father <hi>Paul,</hi> then to ſee the Pope himſelfe. One of the gentlemen of <hi>Venice</hi> that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied the Prince remembred to adviſe him that the father as he was a conſultor of ſtate could not hold any congreſſe with Princes nor their miniſters by the law without a publique knowledge, and leave firſt obtained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the father had leave and was commanded to let the Prince ſee him. To which he obeyed although with a very ill will, onely he would have their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not to be in the Monaſtery, but elſe where and in the pulique preſence of ſome others, as if he had foreſeene what happened afterwards. So the Prince viſited him in the houſe of <hi>Signor Angelo Contarini</hi> a Cavalier who being lately returned from an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy into <hi>France,</hi> was by publike order apointed to Court, &amp; to attend that Prince. In that meeting the father was nothing deceived of what he ſuſpected, that befides the Princes owne curioſitie he ſhould be environed with interrogatories at the inſtance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All the diſcourſe that followed betwixt them is found written with the very conceipts and words that were then ſpoken and remaines where it ought to be. The ſubſtance of it was, that the Prince as he was of great birth which is very well knowne, ſo he was of a great vivacity, and and an extraordinary ſpirit, joyned with great ſtore of learning, and was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98082:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>continually upon a tempting way to ſound the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the ſects of the time, and chiefely concerning the reformed religion in <hi>France</hi> (which he railed on as pernitious to government) and then concerning ſuperioritie betwixt a councell and the Pope, as alſo of the libertie of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, and whether it be lawfull to make uſe of the ſervice in armes of thoſe that diſſent from us in religion, of the excommunicating of Princes, and moſt of all who was the author of the hiſtory of the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which the Prince more by the inſtigation of ſome other then of his owne Genius was defirous to know, (ſuch power hath the contagion of thoſe that practiſe with ſome religious men.)</p>
            <p>This flying diſcourſe full of jumpes of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and interrogatories ſeemed like a floting of waves that were to breake themſelves upon the rocks, of rare, of briefe and of onely neceſſitated anſwers. His blaming of the Hugonets in <hi>France</hi> without touching upon the leaſt pointe of their doctrine was by the father diverted with a ſingular dexteritie, repreſenting to his memory the valour and prudence of his father and grandfather whereof the Prince being very intelligent, did quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what that ſignified.</p>
            <p>Concerning the difference of ſuperioritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and Councells, from that he diſentangled himſelfe by putting him in minde of the Sorbonne, and the alteration and depravation of that ſtate ſince the admiſſion of the Jeſuits into <hi>France,</hi> and the difference which is betwixt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moderne Sorbonits without touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the ſuperiority which the Prince had moſt deſired. And likewiſe the liberties of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98082:93"/>Church, that he paſt over in generall termes, ſaying that the Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> and the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon it ſelfe have maintained theſe liberties, as the naturall rights of all the churches, but in <hi>France</hi> they have beene better defended then elſewhere from the uſurpations of others. As for the making uſe of the armes of thoſe that differ from us in religion, he ſaid no more, but that Pope <hi>Giulio</hi> the ſecond ſerved himſelfe in <hi>Bolognia</hi> of <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth of the <hi>Griſons</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> calling them Angels ſent from God to defend him, and yet that they were but Heretiques. More largely they continued their diſcourſe of the excommunications of Princes and the father reduced the Prince to the hiſtory of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeaventh, of this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>France</hi> making him confeſſe that he had ſeene the private writings and alſo of the ſtates upon the like ſubject, where if the Popes had not preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo far, that Princes ſhould not heare maſſe nor be preſent at other offices, perhaps the controverſies had not growne ſo hot. But the point was, whether Princes had a cauſe of complaint, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of excommunications which are ſpirituall paines, they ſhould ſuffer their ſubjects to rebell againſt them, and be diſobliged of their fidelities and ſubjection which is due to them by lawes both naturall and divine, and ſtirring up warres, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them as far as to lay waite for their lives, and take away their crownes and ſcepters.</p>
            <p>To the point of the author of the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> the father told him that he knew well, that he himſelfe was the man that had divulged it in <hi>France</hi> to be his, and had alſo told aſmuch to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98082:93"/>Ambaſſador of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> then reſident with his Chriſtian Majeſty, whereupon the Ambaſſador was conſtrained to write of it to the publique, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not anſwer him, but onely this; That at <hi>Rome</hi> it was well enough knowne who was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and after this with all his windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings he could get no more out of him.</p>
            <p>He that ſhall conſider throughly of theſe pointes, and that knowes the father, and knowes the Prince well, though of an elevated ſpirit, will give his judgment upon the report that was after divulged, I believe rather from others then from the Prince himſelfe who gave it out that he had confounded the father, and reduced him to ſuch a ſtreightneſſe, that he knew not what to ſay. But as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world without his contrary, nor any thing ſo holy that is not ſubject to a ſiniſter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation after the father was in publike employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that his actions begunne to be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and commented upon, it behooved him to reſtraine himſelfe from ſuch vertuous commerces, wherein he was formerly frequent, although the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions were leſſe frequent. Becauſe thoſe that were ill affected to him, made it a concluſion, that he had no ſincere ſence in the <hi>Romane</hi> religion, becauſe he treated with ſuch indifferency and moderation, not enquiring into occult things that pertained not to him, and that he was now growne more ſenſible of ſuch defamations then he had been formerly: did ariſe from this conſideration (&amp; he ſpake itopenly) becauſe heretofore he had onely treated of things of his owne intereſt: but that being now a ſervant of the Republique it was fit he ſhould deny himſelf the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98082:94"/>pleaſure of thoſe learned converſation, with this reaſon that thoſe impoſtures which were put upon him as a miniſter of ſtate might not redound to the publike prejudice. But his conſtancy in the purity of religion, hath no neede of a defence, nor is it needfull to make a digreſſion upon that. Onely I ſhall touch this particular whereof ſo many men yet living are able to make faith, and which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goes about to deny ſhall finde too many adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to contend with.</p>
            <p>One notable inconvenience from the imprudence of thoſe writers that favoured the Eccleſiaſticall cauſe, in the the yeare 1606, was this; That the cauſe being pure, and meerely temporall, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Juriſdiction, they procured by all their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to repreſent it as a point of religion thinking that to be their abſolute advantage, not ſeeing how they could otherwiſe defend it, or at leaſt inſinuate it to be defenſible either at Court or among the people. In the zeale of this courſe they did ſo far ſurpaſſe the ſtreight line of veritie and conſcience, that they grew to publiſh in conference, in their pulpits, and in printe, that at <hi>Venice</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to change religion, having begunne by the denying of obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by a manifeſt ſchiſme, it is not much to be wondred at that this courſe tooke beginning from a ſwarme of hungry ambitious libellers that were meerly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of former paſſages. But it is more to be admir'd, that ſo wiſe and learned a Cardinall ſhould enter into this dance as <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius</hi> and <hi>Collonna</hi> that had reaſon to know what prejudice ſuch a fame (though falſe and now diſperſt abroad) might bring to the Eccleſiaſtiques.</p>

In all Ariſtocracies, equalitie is by the neceſſity of humane condition moſt unequall, as to the abilitie of the optimates there having never yet beene a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ſociety ſo well choſen that had had not their dreggs among them; otherwiſe Ariſtocracies would conſiſt of ſo many Kings, and the vulgar part of it would be onely among the Optimates. For this reaſon, (although for the defence of their libertie, there were in all their bodies and counſells at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> a ſingular concord, yet) there were all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome ſubjects of more valour and eminency then others that ſerved as guides to the reſt. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons are not to be admitted in common weales, wherefore it will not be fit to name any particulars But ſpeaking of things in generall it was a grace and providence of almighty God that thoſe which were the moſt reſolute and diſpoſed to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence, were the greateſt not onely in nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, honors, experience, hability, and activity, but even for piety and religion. A part of them are yet alive, moſt eminent Senators, and for puritie and reale of holy religion knowne above all others. The reſt of them are paſt away from hence, by a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious death to the glory of the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Eccleſiaſtike ſhot all their curſed darts eſpecially againſt theſe men as the moſt high and conſpicuous objects taxing them for innovators of religion, charging them with a deſigne of making the common weale revolt to the proteſtant religion. The Oltramontanes, that were moſt attentive to the ſucceſſe of theſe paſſages, and to the ſetling of ſo famous a controverſie did greedily reade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatſoever came abroade, believing all to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98082:95"/>true that came from the Eccleſiaſticks with ſuch aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, that the ſerene republique was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obedience to the Pope, and ready to change reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion becauſe thoſe that were the chiefe in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had the ſame deſigne. And thoſe that were the greateſt zelots among them, aſſured with hopes of enlarging their religion, and having obſerved that upon all thoſe occaſions, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had taken to excommunicate Princes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict ſtates, there ever followed ſome notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, thought fit it ſhould be fomented with a hope (which they had already conceived) of a change, and the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> failed not to procure a ſtrikt intelligence with the republique, who when they ſaw the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> declare himſelfe protector of the Eccleſiaſticke partie, were conſtrained for reaſon of good government to heare all, and adhere onely to thoſe whoſe intereſt was conjoyned with their owne. And divers private Doctors were not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſend out pamphlets, which for any diligence that could be uſed in ſuch a confuſion were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſo ſuppreſt, but that they were alſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Venice.</hi> The ſcope whereof was to give col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and credit to that change which the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtiques gave out to be in hand. The heads of all were to propoſe that the Pope excerciſed an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable tyrany over the ſoules and bodies of thoſe that were ſubject to him, and to ſhew the great happineſſe that thoſe eſtates enjoyed that had quit their obedience and might enjoy the goods and lands which were left by pious Chriſtians to pious uſes, which were either imployed to a right uſe, or elſe enjoyed by the people of the countrey to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98082:95"/>benefit, whereas in thoſe ſtates that are under the papacy, there was ſeene an abhominable uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a venality and publique theevery, and which was more, thoſe goods conferred upon ſeditious men, and enemies to thoſe very ſtates where they placed, the Popes being arived at this quint-eſſence of ſubtlety to maintaine in all their dominions a formidable faction which for the moſt part is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraied by the purſe of thoſe very ſtates whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation they had in deſigne. That their religion was the ſame which was contained in holy ſcripture, in generall councels and in the holy fathers of the five firſt ages, agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all the old articles of faith, onely their diſcord is in thoſe that are of their late invention which if any man will examine one by one, he ſhall finde that they make very little to the glory of God, but to the gayning of riches, and reputation and of mundane Juriſdiction to the Eccleſiaſticke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>They further inſinuated that the Romane religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was inſenſibly abaſtarded, and that nothing elſe was reduced to religion, but that which makes for the intereſt and benefit of the Court. They made a collection of the intollerable grievances of Princes who for the preſent make lamentable and continuall complaints. They deſcended to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſerene republique which confining upon the Turks for above eight hundred miles, and as much upon the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and with the Pope very few miles which were nothing but of ſand and ſea-ſhore, yet they received more offence from that ſide and more trouble of juriſdiction in one
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98082:96"/>moneth, then from both the others in ten yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other continuall troubles with their Nuncio's, who where they come to treat with their Prince, they doe it with ſo much inſolencie and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if he were not onely their ſubject, but their ſlave, carrying ſtill before them the head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> the pretence of Religion, to fright the timerous: And the greateſt Politicians that ever were, are not able to penetrate the profundity of the Arcana of the Papacie, by his miſchiefe, which was meerely cauſed by the Eccleſiaſtiques themſelves, and was by them attributed afterwards to thoſe eminent ſubjects in <hi>Venice,</hi> that were the principall maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the publick cauſe.</p>
            <p>But ſtill the Father was hee on whom the blame was laid. He it was (if we believe the Courtiers) that excited Proteſtants to put forth bookes to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the people. He it was that counſelled theſe great men to a neceſſity of a change of Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that the Popes were growne to ſuch a greatneſſe, that nothing could ſerve their turnes but the ſervitude of all <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if ever any thing were falſe and calumnious, it is this; and although the Father ſeem'd not much to regard their defamations, yet ſo farre as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the declaring of himſelf, touching the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that were to be made from time to time with the Senators, he gave his opinion &amp; counſel <hi>viva ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> and vehemently upon all occurrents, and oft in writing upon innumerable counſels, having alwaies taught and inculcated, that not only for truth and conſcience ſake, but even for neceſſity and reaſon of good government, every faithfull man, but moſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98082:96"/>of all Princes ought to invigilate to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and conſervation of Religion. Hee affirm'd that to this end God had conſtituted Princes as his Lieutenants in thoſe ſtates wherein the Church was planted, and conferr'd their greatneſſe upon them, to make them Protectors, Defendors, Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Nurſes of holy Church, as ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures make mention, in which calling, the greateſt of them can never give a ſufficient diſcharge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, except it be by a continuall and vigilant care in matters of Religion. That God by hisſingular grace had placed them in this Catholique Apoſtolick Romane Holy Church, for which they were bound to acknowledge his divine favour, and render him continuall thanks. No greater misfortune being able to befall them from Heaven, then that they ſhould abandon or forſake it. And howbeit there be many abuſes, yet that is not to bee imputed to the fault of Religion, but of them that abuſe it. And all this being moſt true and undeniable, no man ought to ſuffer himſelfe to bee ſhaken in his confidence, nor the Prince to give way that a chang or alteration ſhould be ſo much as ſpoken of. That perfection, and abſolute purity, is the very Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus whereunto the Church, and every faithfull man ought to pretend, though it be not the path where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alwayes they tread. Thoſe Churches which were founded by the Apoſtles themſelves, and where they preach't and reſided, were not exempt from imperfections, whereof the Epiſtle to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians gives a clear teſtimony, but more clearely that to the Corinths. That as for their charity ſome adhered to <hi>Peter,</hi> others to <hi>Paul,</hi> others held of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:98082:97"/>with ſchiſme and expreſs diviſion from Chriſt. As for opinions, there were ſome that denied the Reſurrection. As for concord, they drew their pleadings and differences to the Tribunals of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. As for manners, they had fornication among them, ſuch as was unheard of among the Idolaters. As for cuſtomes, the ſupper of the Lord was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into banquets, where ſome were drunke, and others hungry. And yet all this while the Apoſtle acknowledgeth them to be a true Church, and a body of Chriſt. How much more ought we then to ſtand firme in the Church, where God by his ſingular grace hath ſetled us, although in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof there be imperfections and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are alſo ſince converted into intollerable grievances.</p>
            <p>But if at this day thoſe evils have gotten grouth, the fault will be found to bee in the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who having little regard to the divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which ſo ſtraightly obliges to take knowledge of Gods moſt holy Law, and of Religion, but have altogether neglected this duty, as if Religion were a thing that did not concerne them, and as if they were not to render an account to God, neither for themſelves, nor their ſubjects, by neglecting the care and defence of it againſt the divine precepts of Gods Word, the doctrine of holy Councels and Fathers, and the uſe of pious Princes, contenting themſelves with a Religion, without knowing what it is, nor how it ſhould bee kept from corruption, tolerating for their owne intereſts, their adulation, and connivancies, the coſenage of the people with continuall alterations, under colour of devotion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98082:97"/>and piety, with a dayly licenſe, not onely to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, but to all ſorts of perſons, to invent new orders to their owne gaine, and greatneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering that every cuſtome carries his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit along with it, and ſo Religion becomes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and accommodated to the advancements of them that manage it. And theſe ordinary alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being received, the Princes themſelves have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated them, and ſo they have agreed with poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for approbation, by an authority which time and cuſtome had put upon them. A thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the greateſt part of humane affaires, but moſt in Religion where the vulgar are the inventers of ſuperſtition. The Pope, beſide that he is the head of Religion, is alſo a Prince, and one that from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500 yeares to this day hath aſpired to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of Italy, whereunto he is ſo neare a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And what wonder can be made of it, if he practiſe all the meanes he can to enlarge his juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Hee hath three great charges upon him; that of Religion; that of the Eccleſiaſticall affaires; and the temporaltie of his Eſtate. And the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from which all ill is derived, is in this, that his right is not well diſtinguiſht from that of Princes.</p>
            <p>There are alſo three kindes of Canons, of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, of temporall things, and thoſe that are mixt of both; Of the firſt, the care ought to be in the Ecclefiaſtiques, of the ſecond none can carry the exerciſe beyond their owne temporall eſtates, and for the third, it is as much the dutie of Princes to take care as of the Eccleſiaſtiques themſelves if not more. In all the life of the father, there hath
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98082:98"/>not happened in the moſt ſereene dominion any diſſention of opinion in the leaſt tittle, not in the firſt of theſe three heads becauſe the republique was borne Catholique, and hath alwaies continued ſo. All the diſturbance hath happened upon the ſecond head, whereof the Court hath made uſe to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of their juriſdiction, and of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dominion. From the third, that Prince is too ignorant and unworthy, that ſuffers himſelfe to be excluded. And that the Court at this day more then ever, doe their uttermoſt endeavour to enregiſter and authenticate the excluſion of Princes: yet this is becauſe Princes (having in favour of their cauſe ſuch cleere ſentences from the new and old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Counſells and holy fathers, beſides the practiſe of all times) doe not ſeeke to repaire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If at ſuch times as the Nuntios and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks apeare mask't with religion in pretence, and the ſacred Cannons (abuſing the ſecond and third by the firſt) and if thoſe which governe, and are inſtructed by divine precept, would take notice what thoſe Cannons were which concerne faith (which the republicke inviolately obſerves with high reverence (and thoſe which concerne Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtique affaires of diſcipline, and adminiſtration of goods, of ſecular affaires, and thoſe which concerne neither faith nor religion, but the greatneſſe of the Court, and that they underſtood and would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them the power which God hath given Princes, they would quickly pull off the maske and make thoſe bluſh that thought ſo to abuſe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſimplicitie of others, and would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves from that perpetuall injurie which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98082:98"/>is offered them, as if they had offended religion by defending the power which God hath granted, and the jurisdiction whereof a Prince ought not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer the leaſt diminution, without being guilty of this grievous ſin.</p>
            <p>Of this pious ſence of his, let that ſupreame reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (wherewith in all his conſultations and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, he had alwaies honored the Sea Apoſtolicall and the Popes) be an argument. Although in the meane time he ſpared not to ſet forth the truth in that which concernes the legitimate of power, which God hath given the Prince. But unjuſtly doe theſe men complaine, that would have church-men be without affections <hi>Erunt vitia donec homines,</hi> or of Princes ſervants that ſeeke the advantage of their maſters. If church-men ſerve themſelves of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of religion to this purpoſe, let the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of none but themſelves, if they be not well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough inſtructed to reduce the oppoſites to this point, to make them ſee that the zeale of religion is not weaker in any then in Church-men and ſo to goe no further.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other diſcourſes he uſed, inculcating alwaies the duty of every one for the defence and conſervation of the Catholike religion, and not to ſuffer themſelves to yield to any abuſe how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But the Court (which hath knowne his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and holy courſe of life which began from his childhood, and continued without reprehenſion to his laſt breath in all thoſe exerciſes of religion, which belong) not to a ſuperſitious and paſſionate flatterer of the Court, or a fautor of reformations) but to a ſolide and ſincere Catholicke and a man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98082:99"/>religious by profeſſion) have nevertheleſſe gone ſo far with their calumnies (as to attribute that to him) which God grant be not found in many of themſelves (an indeleble blemiſh) of having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all. God forbid that by the conceipt of theſe men a blameleſſe life, and irreprehenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the view of ſo many ſevere enemies ſhould be thought to be the effect of Atheiſme, and impiety and that the argument of this ſo great a cenſure ſhould be drawne from the opinion of his learning. The divine ſcripture which attributes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme to ignorance, to fooliſhneſſe, to an unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dledneſſe in diſſolutions, and a being given over as a prey to their owne paſſions, hath taught it far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. True it is, that the fooliſh and ignorant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, ſeeing ſome eminent ſubjects in ſciences not to comply with their fooliſh ſuperſtition which are onely tolerated by their owne guides and canonized becauſe they are gainefull, have beene accuſtomed to judge thus ſiniſterly. But it is a judgement is onely worthy of thoſe that formed it. But if a profound knowledge of ſecond cauſes doe induce us to a more tenacious reverence of the firſt (as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> teacheth) the matter is cleare enough. Beſides, that thoſe very Courtiers who having their eyes dazled at ſo great a light of goodneſſe and ſcience; are growne ſo injurious to that rare vertue, as to be frequent in ſuch domeſticall arguments as theſe that thoſe that are fallen from the right hand and have baniſht divinitie from their heart doe uſually ſtrike into one of theſe two extreames, either of a totall diſſolution or a violent ſuperſtition, and perhaps never into the meane. Thanks be to God that in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98082:99"/>of themſelves they muſt confeſſe the contrary of our father, in both theſe, nor doe I believe that the moſt ſuperſtitious, men will ever yeild him the commendation that either in word or actions he ſhewed any favour to their voluntarie worſhip or their other impoſtures. And to ſay the truth, how can any wiſe man comply with their opinions, and ſuperſtitious actions? which are the very quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence of humane fooleries and of higheſt injury to the Creator?</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of publique employment had brought him into the knowledge of the principall men of publique government, whoſe vertues if I ſhould commemorate, with their Honors due unto them it would be neceſſary to engage a volume of praiſes. Let it ſuffice that with all the Grandees of the republicke he was in the greateſt conceipt that any private perſon could obtaine, nay rather, none ſhall ever obtaine the like, till God and nature ſhall produce another father <hi>Paul,</hi> who in that way of prudence, which wee will call converſation hath not onely arrived at that excellent degree, which the wiſeſt have obſerved to have bin onely in <hi>Socrates,</hi> but hath gone beyond it, by converſing with, and admitting to his converſation all ſorts of perſons and profeſſions, and of all ages, and hath got the love of all who had nothing elſe to ſay of him, but of the greatneſſe of his modeſtie, humilitie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilitie.</p>
            <p>In all companies he appeared the maſter, and in the varietie of his opinions ſome went away belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was of theirs, and others thought he had the intentions of <hi>Socrates.</hi> And although he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98082:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>were now growne into yeares, yet with the ſame hilaritie, and cheerefullneſſe, that as he converſt with Senators of his owne age, ſo he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to thoſe young men of the primary nobilitie who conſecrate their witts to vertue, and to their countrey with honour, which wee will call the <hi>Tyrocinium</hi> or the young Militia of ſtate in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, who are called among vs <hi>Savii dordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> the wiſe men of the orders.

The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoyced infinitely among the other ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and rare qualities and vertues that were in him, at this veracity, and would ſay freely <hi>Lodate iddie che ho pur trovata uno che mi parla non in Maſchera,</hi> praiſed be God that I have met with one man that ſpeakes not to me in a maske. And verily Signor <hi>Marce</hi> told him without a vaile the truth of all things in <hi>Venice,</hi> the conditions of perſons, their intereſts, their deportments, whereof he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite information, but where he diſcovered any defects in the father himſelfe, thoſe with all candour. They call you (ſaith he to him) the Patrone of your affections. And I obſerve you to have affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like other men though different. This perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fitting in your Cell, and turning over bookes which are not legible to others, this ſhutting your ſelfe up in your ſtudy without ever coming abroade. This unrelented way of reading and writing (father) is a kinde of intemperance, as heretofore were my amorettes and wantonneſſe, but yet with this difference that opinion gives a title of lewdneſſe to one, and to the other names of honor.</p>
            <p>He proceeded to tell him, that in this he ſeemed rather to be in a degree of obſtinacy then otherwiſe becauſe in a declining age he would not remit, but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98082:101"/>intend thoſe travells which in his more vigorous yeares, he was hardly able to undergoe. He told him further (ſmiling) this is (pardon me) a kind of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that raignes in you, and a thouſand other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and facetious galantries. The firſt time that they diſcourſt together, The father (who as his manner was to ſay much in a few words) ſaid when he was gone. This treviſanetto hath a great heart (allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the littleneſſe of his body that had yeilded ſo far to the greatneſſe of his minde) and is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for great reſolutions. But after he came to know of the friendſhip that was betwixt him and Signor <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> which, (let it be lawfull for me to ſpeake of a thing that by fatall encounters hath raiſed it ſelfe to ſuch a height that it hath wearied all penns) He was alſo willing to contribute ſomething to ſo rare a worke. It was not fit that ſo high a fabricke of vertue ſhould be raiſed at <hi>Venice,</hi> except this great Architect put his hand to it. And hearing Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Marco</hi> recount the various accidents that had paſt betwixt them, &amp; a deſire of a totall tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and transfuſion not onely of externall things but of themſelves: according to that of <hi>Amicorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never in ſuch a degree as afterwards it prooved to be betwixt theſe gentle-men. And having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome excellent doctrines concerning friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he did appoint <hi>Fulgentio</hi> to tranſlate out of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italian</hi> that eſſay of <hi>Michael di Montagna</hi> of friendſhip which ſo ſoone as it was done. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not relate how acceptable it was to both theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, finding in their owne hearts and affections
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98082:101"/>not onely thoſe conditions of friendſhip which that great perſon had expreſt with ſo rare examples ſet out for an <hi>Idea</hi> of a perfect friendſhip, but alſo to finde therby how far they had exceeded his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And there was nothing elſe to be done but to raiſe that fabricke to the height, which after among civill vertues was growne to be the right of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The preparations to it were infinite, not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mutuall offices, the foundation was a faith and ſecure confidence, that one might believe his friend as far as himſelfe. The conſtruction a meere chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which hath ſhewed the world that <hi>Signor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> did in a moment and not by degrees ſtrip himſelfe of thoſe exceſſes and inveterated habits of vices of laſcivious delights and other things which had brought him to a poore fortune, becauſe he would not be thought to be a waſter of thoſe fortunes, whereof he was now by the vertue of friendſhip made a Patron. And in Signor <hi>Barbarigo</hi> that had a wife and many children to be able in his life time to make another man the abſolute Patrone of his fortunes, whom all men knew to be the conſumer of his owne, and upon no other conſideration ſave onely of being his friend.</p>
            <p>But the father did not live to ſee the garland with which this fabricke was crowned with the two <hi>Pyramides</hi> which were carved and ingraven by the knife of all the judicious with a <hi>Non plus ultra.</hi> All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in his life time he might ſee Signor <hi>Marco</hi> (in the houſe of <hi>Barbarigo</hi>) Lord and Patrone of all and knew by his ſpeculation, that they having ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their hearts that rule of <hi>Amicorum omnia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia</hi> might alſo make an externall practiſe of it,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98082:102"/>in all and every thing elſe. Wherein his charitie (the greateſt inventreſſe of the world) did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward put him in minde in a way to effect it, by procuration and teſtament ſo far as it was in the power of law to doe it. And theſe gentlemen have arrived at ſuch a perfection of charitie that to die one for another (which hath beene reputed the ſupreame point of friendſhip) in a mutuall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and readineſſe, and not in ſhadowes but by effectuall preſenting themſelves to dangers, is a thing ſo far below their love, that they ſpeake of it as a thing not to be eſteemed, and wherein they know no imaginable difficultie. Many have ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this affection could not laſt alwaies, and the father himſelfe obſerving the violence of Signor <hi>Marco</hi> made a queſtion of it. But being after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> if the minde may be called a Sea in reſpect of affections, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then this of his was a ſmooth ſea and alwaies calme, and toward his friend without windes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ebbing or flowing an eternall tranquilitie, and a minde though without oſtentive profeſſion of knowledges; yet capacious of all things, eſpecially thoſe that regard humanitie. Then he changed his opinion, and believed it would be perpetuall, and ſaid it was like the conjunction of iron and ſteele were the one gave toughneſſe, and the other gave edge, and as it happened afterwards, I my ſelfe thinking of their friendſhip, which at this day is one of the glories of our Citty: and of our age:, have concluded, that if it were poſſible for a diviſion to riſe betwixt theſe two, it could not be upon any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98082:102"/>other ground then this, that if it came in queſtion to expoſe themſelves to any danger the one and the other would be he, and each would conteſt that the other ſhould be reſerved, both believing they had reaſon, being ſo ſharpened in their charities, as to explicate, and confute each others reaſons, and without doubt this would have put them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, if charitie it ſelfe had not found a remedy of their being alwaies together, whereſoever any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould have happened, becauſe nature does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that two ſhould be one alone except it be by a concordance of wills. And I am of opinion, that that next to that degree already eſteemed the higheſt (which is to lay downe, not verbally but really their lives for one another) they have arrived at that great point to which, as yet it is believed that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor morall vertue never came, but in this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effect of an excellent divine charitie, that if it fell into queſtion that one of them ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to damnation, and divine wrath, the ſtrife would be betwixt them which ſhould take it upon himſelfe and preſerve his friend. In which kinde of acceſſe I finde no example in the courſe of hiſtories nor in the redundance of divine graces, among mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall relations of ſuch an affection in any kinde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were of thoſe two great Heroes, and divine men <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in a fable of a kinde of darke report of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> which hath but little to doe with this living and knowne example of ours, becauſe they underſtood not what it was to be either bleſt or damned. And if among the Heroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ique vertues there was found out an Apotheoſis which is nothing elſe then an extenſion of vertues
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98082:103"/>and humane conditions to a perfection not humane but chimericall and imaginary, then with more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity by true and reall acts, and not diſtant from us either in times or places, but exiſtent and under our eyes have theſe two gentlemen ſo well deſerving of humanitie merited for having taught us a new way of vertue, and made us ſee that a ſole conſent in all things both divine and humane, is not a bargaine of wit alone, as hitherto the world hath believed it to be, but a reall worke truly heroicall and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, whereat love and benevolence can onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, not onely to be admired, and had in venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an Idea of true friends, but to be reputed the tutelar powers or numen of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding it be very true, that to multiply knowledge, is to encreaſe travaile and ſorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poore Father, from the fame of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the dexterity of his wit, the charity of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that came to him, and of a goodneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to doe well, was become noe only the ſervant of the publique, but of particular men; not onely of this City, but of the whole State, and even to ſtrangers, becauſe in all difficult cauſes his opinion was ſought and appeared in all things like the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a divine oracle and to the wonder of the world that his anſwers how unpremeditate ſoever were yet ſo wiſe and ſolide to the moſt arduous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demands, that upon a long meditation they could not have beene made better either for brevitie or ſpeaking to the point. And whatſoever proceeded from that bleſſed mouth of his was fixt gold weighed in the ballance of more then humane judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:98082:103"/>
That which made him moſt admir'd was the coupling together of vertues, and with conditions which are not uſually met in one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as knowledge and humilitie, prudence with meekneſſe, retiredneſſe and officiouſneſſes, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pleaſantneſſe, arguteneſſe without offence, brevity and perſpicuity, ſweetneſſe and ſolidity. But it appeares that ſcience hath a veneficke vertue of ſwelling many men; but that is only proper to vaine and ſuperficiall ſciences, but that which is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and profound is on the contrary like an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to caſt downe every proud thought, and the father had particularly ſpent ſo much of his time in the ſtudy and knowledge of humane nature, that if it ſhould pleaſe God that ſome forme were but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his notes that he left upon that argument, I am certaine that hitherto, no Philoſopher hath ſpeculated ſo far into the knowledge of humanitie. And I ſay boldly that in all courſe of time hitherto, none ever arived at the depth of that nothing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſo it may be lawfull for me to call it) becauſe the father himſelfe ſaid ſo, who eſteemed himſelfe as nothing. It is remembred by one that told him of his humilitie that he bluſht like a virgin to heare himſelfe praiſed for any of his excellent parts. And although he thought very well of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman yet living, and full of philoſophicall and politique learning, and an eloquent orator, yet the father avoided him what he could for this onely reaſon, that when he ſaluted him he entituled him alwaies <hi>Illuſtriſſimo Padre</hi> which was done with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his vertue and merit, and not according to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98082:104"/>complements. And he reſolved that his friend <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio</hi> ſhould acquainte him with his diſlike of thoſe ſalutations but the gentleman anſwered him againe. To whom then can that title be due? if it be not due to that angell of heaven. And alwaies when he made enquiry of his health, or how he did, he would doe it in that or the like ſort. How does, or what does that Angell of <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> This was all the fruit of his great ſtudies, which were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt to oſtentation but to true wiſdome, to the cultivating of his minde (which is the greateſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this life) and to humility.</p>
            <p>Prudence for the moſt part makes men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rigide, and difficall to be treated with, and truly in former times the father hath beene taxed of ſuch defects, and he himſelfe in his anatomy of his affections and defections, where it appeares that he had liſted them all for a combate and for a victory to be had over them (which he had deſigned) and there he acknowledge him ſelfe to be ſevere inoffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and hard to pleaſe. But he had now ſo van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht thoſe diſpoſitions that his affabilitie and mildneſſe was growne to be ſingular: his modeſtie ſo marvelous; that when he ſaw another in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or that he underſtood not the buſineſſe, he would never uſe a ſharpe reprehenſion, but bring them to a review and confute them with ſo civill language, that he left them not without ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of his owne propenſion to their opinions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſing himſelfe that what he could not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto was, by reaſon of his owne incapacity, which neither gave him leave to ſee the reaſons that had induced them, nor how to reſolve well upon his owne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:98082:104"/>
And for that officiouſneſſe wherein (it ſeemes) when he was in a lower fortune, he had been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He was growne ſo prompt and obſequious, that if he could doe a ſervice, or a courteſie to him that required it of him, hee would bee ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that he could not conceale his diſpleaſure. In one thing he was inſuperable to himſelf, in activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and reſolution, becauſe as in things of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was ſodaine and ready: So in conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were to be put in action, hee was growne ſlow and irreſolute. He would turne over, and revolve, and never ſeem ſatisfied, and this fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſtill increaſt upon him, whereupon I am ſometimes of opinion, that a prudence in medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity makes men active, and reſolute; but too great an one, with an extraordinary knowledge of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and obſervation of examples and events, makes men timerous and reſty. Or whether this this be a weakneſſe proper, and inſuperable by old age, or whether in the greatneſſe of his ſoule, from that time forward, he beheld all thoſe things ſo far below himſelfe, as to make that a Remora to his activity. I am only ſure that he was now reduced to ſo great an indifferencie concerning humane events, as no man could aſpire to a greater.</p>
            <p>Now I am in a kinde of neceſſity of defrauding the Father of that which ſhould be the top and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame degree of his heroique and moſt perfect vertues, and which would make him to appear to be of an intrepide heart, and of a conſtancie which in a good cauſe were invariable, by telling the true occaſion for which ſome Senators, not onely the principall, but the very prime ones, and of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98082:105"/>Families, conceiv'd ſome ill affections towards him, which while they were alive, and ſome of them after the Fathers death, could not diſſemble. Now with reverence to their illuſtrious Poſterities, let them ever preſerve this picture of the Father tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without either too much light, or in the pureſt colours, and let it be drawne over with this veile, That <hi>Fra: Paulo</hi> (ſuch as he was) never had any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, neither as he was a publique ſervant, nor a Conſultor of State, nor ever incurr'd the ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of any, except it were for a publique cauſe.</p>
            <p>This famous man pleaſed himſelf with a writing of his, where he acknowledged hee had contracted the hatred of ſome great ones, and great in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet ſuch as did for the moſt part poſtpoſe the publique honour, to their own intereſt, and private commodities. Hee might have comforted himſelfe yet further in this, that neither for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes nor threatnings, they were able to make him decline the leaſt point from that which was either of juſtice, or publique ſervice. And it was not becauſe he was ignorant how much it might have turned to his advantage to have done otherwiſe, or that hee had it not alwayes in his mouth <hi>Conviene fedelmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſervire:</hi> And therefore he would doe nothing but what belong'd to his charge, nor more willingly then what hee was commanded by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Senate.</p>
            <p>But in a charge ſo univerſall, it is impoſſible that ſomething of the publique ſervice ſhould not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the intereſts and affections of private men, which are a part of the body of government, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98082:105"/>in particular concerning Eccleſiaſtick Benefices, and cauſes of that kinde, wherein they are blinded by their paſſions; for which reſpect the Father would alwayes ſay, the Common-weal chad need to have both a Divine and a Canoniſt among them; to which purpoſe, before his death hee had publiſh't a little tract, but to his friends he would ſay more freely, that no man could bee able for ſuch a ſervice, that had not troden under his foot both hopes and feares. The reaſon of which ſpeech ſhall be beſt underſtood by him that beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Government, and knowes how impoſſible it is to find a body ſo united to the publique good, in which there ſhall not be ſome that will hate and threaten, and perſecute, when they apprehend that any one ſhall oppoſe the deſignes of their private profit, how neceſſary, and cleare, and juſt ſoever the oppoſition bee, and this for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in Ariſtocracies.</p>
            <p>The fervour, and totall dedication of himſelfe (next after God) to the publique ſervice, may take argument from hence, that hee was alwayes reſolv'd, that by his meanes, nor for his ſake, no controverſies ſhould ariſe. But under <hi>Paul</hi> 5. there was no occaſion, becauſe all diſcord was put to ſilence, as it was conſidered before. But <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15th being created his Succeſſor, the Father had heard of ſome diſcourſe that was uſed by him to the Venetian Ambaſſadours that were ſent to congratulate his Election, that there would never be a perfect peace betwixt the Republick, and the Sea Apoſtolick, but ſuch a one as the Father <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould approve of. Whereupon the Father in that now
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98082:106"/>declining age of his, was ſtrongly reſolv'd, rather then there ſhould be any difference, not onely to withdraw himſelfe from the ſervice of that Senate, but declining the Popes anger if he ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered (as not long after it removed out of his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and there were no more words of it, it being the nature of that Pope not to inſiſt long upon any thing; and perhaps in this hee was not moved of himſelfe, but by ſome others, or elſe that he had received ſome more briefe and ſignificant ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then hee expected) to retire himſelfe out of the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> And becauſe to have ſo diſpoſed of himſelf (as many great ſpirits would have done) neither his conſcience, nor religion, could well beare, and to paſſe himſelfe into a Proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had been to expoſe himſelfe to calumnies; or if into thoſe States where the Court and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks have an abſolute power, had beene without prudence to hazard himſelf againe to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſtillettoes, hee reſolv'd to goe into the Eaſt Countries, to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or into ſome other place, and made preparations accordingly. Hee deſired to be inform'd from ſome that had made voyages, and particularly from an Hebrew, that had gone thither often by land, to bee diſtinctly inſtructed of every thing. He had found meanes alſo to have a paſport from the Port of the grand Signor againſt the dangers of that voyage, in caſe he went no further. He was alſo reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome proviſions for his owne uſe, whereof he was a creditor, and had formerly uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and give away in almes, and otherwiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping any for himſelfe, and the ſumme that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98082:106"/>after remained in the Convent was about 1000. Duccats, and conſequently he had all things in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to encounter with any adverſe fortune, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that for his ſake, eitherhis country or his Prince (whom hee had faithfully ſerved) ſhould ſuffer the leaſt inconvenience, although he were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure enough, that the Senate would rather have undertaken a war for him, than abandoned his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>And of this tranſmutation he would ſpeak with all cheerfulneſſe, and ſay that in his age he ſhould enjoy that which in his youth he had extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired, which was a peregrination, which although in his minde he had much affected, knowing by Geography as much as could be known of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Scituations and People, and by Hiſtory their actions and cuſtomes, yet that ſeem'd to him, in reſpect of that which a man ſees with his eyes, but a dark knowledge, <hi>un ſapere in ombra,</hi> and the deſire of knowledge encreaſeth with yeares. God and Nature gave him not leave to prove what the ſucceſſor of <hi>Gregory</hi> intended, <hi>Maffeo Barbarini Vrban</hi> the 8. who (as it was ſayd) was Nuncio in <hi>France,</hi> when he was created Cardinal 1606. having given teſtimonies of an implacable hatred againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by actions not worthy of a Chriſtian, and by inventions moſt baſe and chymerical, which for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we ſilence, and not to poſſeſſe the world, that the petulancy of ſpeaking and writing falſhoods and calumniations, (a thing bred in the bones of our moderne Eccleſiaſtiques) is arrived at the very height. In this ſtate of abſoluteneſſe in all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, perfection of judgement, without defect of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98082:107"/>which in him was ſo rich, and more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than ever was in any, and with ſuch health, as ſuch a complexion could beare in a perſon ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tired out in the manage of ſo great affairs, and without any relaxation at all, except ſometimes in ſeeing his friends: He entred upon the yeare of his age 69. and in the end of Lent, in <hi>Sabbato Santo</hi> being in his accuſtomed place, which was a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Roome of the Senate houſe, there fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him ſuch a ſudden coldneſſe, as if he had been frozen, and withall a hoarſeneſs inſtantly upon his voice, with a fearfull benumb'dneſſe, being the firſt time in his life that he had known what a Catarrhe was, and it held him above three moneths with a manifeſt Ague; for all which yet he would not change his way of living, nor diminiſh his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. An apparent declination of his ſtrength was to be diſcerned, and he would alwaies ſay, that he was never well after that diſtemper.</p>
            <p>But as that continued indiſpoſition did ſignifie a divine admonition, it was alſo obſerv'd by his nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends; that in things of the ſpirit, hee was much more devote and attentive than he had been formerly, and particularly in meditation more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidual; ſo that, whereas before, beſides his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers, and ſpirituall exerciſes the reſt of his time was ſpent either in making one of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reade to him, or write at his appointment, or In writing himſelfe. After this time, he had no more reading or writing, but preciſely what the neceſſity of his charge, and publique ſervice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him unto. All the remainder was ſpent in the meditation of another life, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he diſpatcht <hi>Fra. Marco,</hi> who at his returne
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98082:107"/>found him in his uſuall place, which was before a Crucifix, at the foot whereof he had (as 'tis ſayd) a naturall deaths head, whereunto hee was ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive that <hi>Fra. Marco</hi> at his comming in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſurpris'd him before he could take notice of him; and yet he was willing to diſguiſe his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as farre as he could, becauſe when hee had a deſire to be alone, he would fay to him, that hee might goe abroad a while; becauſe he defired to give himſelfe a little paſtime in making caſtles in the aire of Mathematicall concluſions, and give his braines a little libertie to range where they pleaſed. And when he was ſurpriſed at his devotion, he was alwaies ready with ſome excuſe or other, that hee had either fabricated inſtruments, or figures, or the like. But before a Crueifix and a deaths head, it may well be imagined that he had other contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations more ſutable to his age and ill affected body. Thus he went on, bearing up as well as hee could, till his entrance upon Winter 1622. be in then entred into the year of his age 71: when a manifeſt defaillance of vitall vertue was viſible in him, and the declination of his forces gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſignes of the diſlodging which this great ſoule (who in it ſelfe had never felt old age) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ready to make from the cottage of his body. His ſtature was meane, his head compar'd to his body was great, becauſe he was ſo very leane, that inwardly he ſeem'd but a frame of bones; yet his head accus'd him not to be ſuch, but rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In the hinder part and upward it was round, and well proportioned, his forehead very ſpacious, and declining a little from the middle part toward
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98082:108"/>the left ſide. There appeared ſo great a vein, that ending about the middeſt where his noſe begun to riſe, when it was full, it ſhewed as bigge as a finger, and when it was emptie it left a channell, where a little finger might be layd, and it would often change from fulneſſe to emptineſſe. His eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes were well archt, his eyes great, quick, and black; and in his ſight till he was 55 he had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary livelineſſe, that if with others he had read a Letter, he had ſooner read it all over than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother had read the beginning. His noſe was large and long, but very ſtreight, little beard, and thinne, and in ſome places without haire, but yet without deformitie. Looking him in the face you would rather have thought it fleſhly than otherwiſe. His colour pleaſing, and when he was in health, was mixt with white and red, with a little yellowneſs, which became him not ill. His neck was ſutable to the reſt, only ſhewing meagerneſſe. Altogether hee had a grave aſpect, but pleaſant, and inviting one to treate with him. His hand was fair and very long, and his fingers ſeem'd to turne backwards, and were of an exceeding length. He ſuffered ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily extreme cold in his hands and feete; for which he had not found a better remedy then warme Irons, which he carried alwaies in balls wrapt up. But at the entrance of Winter, his paſſibilitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo much upon him, as if his hands and feet had been turned to iron or ſtone, receiving from within no heat, and externally but a flying heate. His face falne, his lips that had wont to bee coloured, eſpecially the nether lip, with a ſmiling kinde of ſweetneſſe, were growne livide. So it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98082:108"/>ſeemed he had chang'd his forme. His eyes hollow, without their wonted vivacity. Nothing could be found to keepe him warme. He had loſt his appetite that it was not poſſible to finde that meate for him, which after once taking he grew not to loathe, and in that he grew to wonder that he had no more command upon himſelfe. And although that at that age he had all his teeth left, yet he began to chew his meate with much difficultie. He began to goe double, and very heavily, ſcarce able to goe up and downe into his gondola, but worſe up a paire of ſtaires.</p>
            <p>In his dreames that little that he ſlept, was no more of his wonted non-ſence, or incongruities, but diſtinct naturall, ſpeculative, and regularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive, which he that obſerved all things, did not onely obſerve to himſelfe, but conferred of it with his friends, and called a riſing by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his ſoule from the bond and commerce with his body. And thus much I doe not finde that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have obſerved, but having told it you of ſo great a perſon as this, it may perhaps upon ſome or others make a refection. Now nothing more could give him entertainment not ſo much as to heare a a relation of the ſucceſſe of affaires how the world went, wherein he had from his childhood a ſpeciall delight even to this time. One onely delight remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, in his waking after divine meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to revolve in his minde his mathematicall and Aſtronomicall figures, and he would ſay ſmiling; How many words, and how many wits have beene framed in my braines. He had all the ſignes of a ſoule that was ready to take her leave of her old bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98082:109"/>whoſe health beginning now to faile, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied onely by an indefatigableneſſe of minde, ſo that he never forſooke his former charge, but gave anſwers to the exhortations of his friends, and the authorities of his Patrones, concerning the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his travailes, ſaying; That this office was to ſerve, and not to live, and that every one ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies die in his profeſſion above all the Signor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Treniſano</hi> (whoſe liberty and veracity the father ſingularly approoved) He would often reproach him of a manifeſt intemperance for ſeeming to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his ſtudies and his travell as he had done at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times when his ſtrength was greater and that it was an indiſcretion in him not to be ſenſible of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching age, and other ſuch lilke things which he would heare with delight but yet without ever ſlacking or letting his bow ſtand unbent. Many times he had ſo manifeſt a failing of his ſtrength that he was conſtrained as he went a long the ſtreete of the Mercery, to leane and ſtay himſelfe upon the armes of <hi>Fra. Marco.</hi> And he would not conceale his being ill but gave manifeſt tokens upon divers occaſions of foreſeeing his inſtant end whereof he ſpoke more then he was wont to doe not onely with a freedome of minde, and as of a debt to nature and and an indifferent thing, but manifeſt cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as of a long reſt after a weary daies journey. And beſides his ejaculated praiers which he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted often with devout ſentences of ſcripture, he would moſt frequently ſay <hi>Nunc dimittis Domine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum tum,</hi> and to his familiars, courage my maſters, wee are almoſt at the end of our journey. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time as he went to conferre of buſineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98082:109"/>the government of the province, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the time being at hand that they were to nominate a Prior in this convent of the <hi>Servi,</hi> the father ſpoke aloud to the provinciall that was preſent, and others. <hi>A queſto penſarete voi</hi> here looke you to that I pray you, for I ſhall not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But he would often ſay to his familiar friends in a jeſting way, that he ſhould die in ſecuritie now that at his death there could be no miracles done, becauſe <hi>Baromus, Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Colomna,</hi> and the Pope himſelfe were ſo lately dead before him, and almoſt all thoſe that had written of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticke part although they were ſo much younger then he, alluding to that raſh way of writing which ſome men uſe who if a man happpen to die in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with the <hi>Romane</hi> Court, they write that ſame heavie judgment befell him, or that he was ſtrangely dead, and that God had inflicted ſome other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon him, as if having formed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a God after their fancies, they had alſo made him the executor of their partiall and intereſted votes, or as if God had nothing elſe to doe but to puniſh and afflict ſuch as were fallen into their diſſavour, or that thoſe that were united in faction to them, could be preſerved from death more then others. And with ſuch petulances as thoſe their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were for the moſt part ſtuft.</p>
            <p>But Chriſtmas being come, whereof Father <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio</hi> uſed alwaies to put him minde of (being the moſt holy feaſt of the nativity of our Lord) with accuſtomed complement which was merely uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves to ſalute the father by ſaying, <hi>Ad multos annos ſancte pater &amp;c.</hi> He freely made anſwer
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98082:110"/>that this was the laſt that he ſhould ſee, and that ſo ſeriouſly, that it was well diſcern'd to be ſpoken with more earneſtneſſe then that which he had wont to ſay, concerning the brevity of his future end. And no doubt now he began to feele himſelfe very ill; and that he was in a high feaver becauſe at other times, he had not uſed to change his cuſtome for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny length or continuance of ſeaver. On the day of the Epiphany it appeared that his ſickneſſe trode upon his heeles, and that morning he tooke phyſick, which made him worſe, becauſe being cal'd to goe to the palace, he would not excuſe himſelfe neither by ſickneſſe, nor that he had taken a medicament (ſuch was his modeſty) So being called the ſecond and third time, he went, but returned with a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt impairement of his health, being not able for 2 daies following either to take food or reſt, yet for all this he could not keepe his bed, but riſing upon ſunday about eight a clocke he celebrated maſſe, and went to the table, at the refectory, where after he had dined, came Signor <hi>Lingi Scchim</hi> to viſite him, and walkt with him a pretty while, <hi>Secchim</hi> perceived that he was very ill, and told him ſo, which he confeſt, and that of neceſſitie he muſt goe lie downe, which he did, (according to his cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome) in his clothes upon a cheſt, cauſing a coverlet to be throwne over him.</p>
            <p>He continued thus till friday following, betwixt ſuch time and his death there was but another day, ſtill riſing out of his bed, and clothing himſelfe and doing his ordinary function, as reading and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and when he could doe no more, to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the cheſt, and make others reade to him.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98082:110"/>But his infirmitie being one of the greateſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the greatneſſe of his minde, deſerves to be more particularly knowne, and I am reſolved to ſet it downe with the ſame narrative, which with ſome other notes of the remainder of his life are come to my hands, becauſe that proverbe ſeldome failes (<hi>ze'l modo della morte e ſincer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vpon munday morning being riſen out of his bed and having put on his clothes, he was ſurpriſed with a totall defailling both in his hands and his leggs, on which he was not able to ſtand without ſupport, nor move the other without trembling, which was followed with ſo great an abhorment of his foode, that if it had not beene borne out by the ſtrength of his reſolution he could not have received a cordial But this accident did not at all diſable his minde nor deprive him of a fullneſſe of judgement accompanied with the ſame memory, and that which was of moſt importance, his tranquilitie and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe of mind never forſook him, in which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he remained till ſaturday, comforting thoſe that were about him, and alwaies intermixing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was facetious, ſo that upon the ſaturday he ſaid to thoſe that were about him, I have made you merry as long as I was able, and now I can doe ſoe no longer, you muſt cheere me up. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was ſuſpected by the Phyſicians to be the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an epilepſie, &amp; there were ſome that ſuſpected poiſon. But truely there was nogreat ſigne either of the one or the other, but rather of a naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and extinction of vitall ſpirits. And being opened aftes his death, there was found in all his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98082:111"/>parts the faireſt conformitie that could be deſired, except that his heart was exceeding little, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (as it were) to be deſerted. His ſtomack was without any thing in it, either good or bad, but without all figne of offence. The Tueſday after, he took his Phyſick, but it did him no good. On Wedneſday he would goe out of his chamber, and goe dine in the Refectory, from whence to his chamber, beſides the ſtaires, was a good diſtance, and he went it ſupported by two, all trembling as as he went, but with his former courage. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all viſits, diſcourſt of all occaſions that hee had uſed to doe, and nothing of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, except with the Phyſician (and that very ſhort) and ſo paſt his time, fitting upon a ſtoole, and hearing one read to him.</p>
            <p>In all thoſe dayes he made a moſt exact examen of his ſoule, with a totall reſignation unto God, and with a heart as cheerfull as his body was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and from thoſe that were preſent, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed much of his infirmitie, that neither by ſhew of griefe, nor voice of laments, nor intermiſſion of his hilaritie, any thing could be diſcovered, except only by his want of ſtrength, and by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horment of meats, which accuſed him of a manifeſt relaxation.</p>
            <p>I would have no man thinke that he had not a ſull knowledg of his own Eſtate, although to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> when he askt him often how he did, (as he uſed to doe in all his ſickneſſe,) and whether he thought he were like to die of this, he anſwered him, that he thought he ſhould have a long ſickneſſe, and perhaps fall into a quartane; but to the Phyſician, his moſt cordiall friend, Signor <hi>Pietro Aſſilenco,</hi> when he firſt ſaw his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98082:111"/>he put his finger in his mouth, as men uſe to doe when they would have filence kept, and then the Father told him freely his eſtate, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not to diſcover it to Father <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> that it might not torment him. But hee might have knowne it long before, conſidering the Fathers preparations, and what he had told him. Many times in his life he would ſay, that he truſted in God, that he ſhould know when he was neare his end, but that hee would not ſpeake of it to any but to <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> becauſe it was to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to breed confuſion, and make them give over thoſe diligences which God would not have omitted. But he did not obſerve that rule, for now he conceal'd his Eſtate, and did not think it needfull to be known any further then it manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it ſelfe. On Thurſday in the morning hee ſent to call <hi>Amante</hi> di <hi>Breſcia,</hi> the Prior of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, deſiring him to recommend him to the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Fathers, and that after celebration of divine ſervice, he would be pleaſed to bring him the holy communion, telling him further, that he had lived in the poverty of the Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of his own. That whatſoever was in the chambers, was granted him for his uſe, as others had the like, and being in his hands, it was as it had been alwayes, at the free diſpoſition of his ſuperiours, and gave him a little key of a Cupboard, wherein were the remainder of the proviſions which the Republick had beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, nothing being ſhut, but all open, except that cupboard, and one other, wherein all the writings were kept that concern'd the publique, which ſhould not be medled with. Yet he put on his cloaths, as he had been uſed to doe, and ſpent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98082:112"/>all that morning in hearing ſometime <hi>Fulgemio,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Fra. Marco,</hi> reading either Pſalmes, or the Stories of the holy Evangeliſts, of the paſsion of our Saviour, making them ſtop whenſoever he was entred into any devout meditation. Many times hee deſired to try whether he could kneele upon his knees, but the freeneſſe of his ſpirit could no longer rule the languidneſſe of his body. As ſoon as Maſſe was ended, the Fathers of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery came together upon the ſounding of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bell, and proceſſionally the Father Prior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the reſt (with torches in their hands) brought him the holy Sacrament, which he being apparrelled, and laid upon his bed, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſuch demonſtrations of piety, as could be expected from ſo pure a ſoule; and drawing teares from the eyes of all that ſtood about him, leaving an impreſſion in their hearts of a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a religious man, that was well prepared to paſs to a bleſſed life.</p>
            <p>All this while he would not endure that any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in th the night ſhould watch with him in the chamber where he lay, which was obſerv'd by him in all his ſickneſſes, and it was not poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to the contrary, ſaying, that it onely ſerv'd for pomp, and to incommodate others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing him any good, onely it was his diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſee another loſe his reſt. And becauſe <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio</hi> had ſhewed his reſolution to keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to ſit up with him, hee roſe the next morning, and put on his cloathes, though very weak, and would goe ſupported from the firſt to the ſecond chamber to try (as he ſaid) whether his ſences ſerv'd him, and what ſtrength was left him. But (as it was believed) it was only to ſee
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98082:112"/>whether there were a preparation of another bed for him in that chamber. Whereupon <hi>Fulgentio</hi> told him; Father you make preparations as if you were to die within an houre, and yet you would hide your eſtate from mee, as if your infirmitie would continue many months; whereto he made anſwer; and why? muſt we not alwayes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared?</p>
            <p>The Father was moſt obſervant of all kinde of Lawes, and among ſo many novelties of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, which had been ordained in the ten laſt Popedomes, he accommodated himſelfe with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable readineſſe and facilitie to all, howbeit hee did not much approve of them, becauſe things of cuſtome (he ſaid) had their remedies, but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations are never without their miſchiefes, againſt which we have learn'd no cure. But whatſoever was ordained, he was ever the firſt in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it, whereof hee gave an eſſay, that in the morning, being Friday, he would neither take meat nor broth, nor any thing elſe, that was not common to the day; and it ſeem'd a difficulty to perſwade him to take any thing but Lenten meats, and in taking his dinner, he turn'd him to his Cook <hi>Fra: Coſiuio,</hi> and meekly ſaid to him, doe you treate your friends of this faſhion, to make them break faſting dayes? (It was not ſuperſtition, but a conſtant tenacitie, and an habited cuſtome to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ordinations with all exquiſiteneſſe, though the leaſt, and not eſſentiall.) For this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had alwaies entirely obſerved Lent untill the 69. of his age, valuing above all things the giving of good example.</p>
            <p>The night being come, he was reſolv'd to be in the firſt chamber upon any terms, and there he had
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98082:113"/>three in his company with him. But conſider a little while the conſtancie of a ſick man. He was a dying man, and of a languiſhment by defect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that day it was neceſſary to put him in minde of his reſtoratives, yet hee continued all that night without ſpeaking a word to any of them, ſerving himſelfe of thoſe things that were neceſſary from their accuſtomed places where they were uſed to bee laid. And hee was never heard to ſay any thing, except ſometimes <hi>oh Dio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Saturday (the laſt of his life) was the only day that he remained in his bed, in great lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of body, but full ſtrength of minde, whereof they took this for a demonſtrative docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That morning the Prince of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> with the reſt of the Senate ſent for <hi>Fulgentio</hi> to come to them, who being demanded of the ſtate of the Father, and having anſwered them that he thought he was drawing to his laſt gaſp without any hope of life, the excellent Signor <hi>Ocavian bon Savie</hi> deſired to know how he was in his minde, and having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him that in that languiſhing of his forces, the Prince and their illuſtrious Excellencies might know that in his judgement and his memory he was the ſame <hi>Maeſtro Paolo</hi> that for 17 years paſt they had known him to be, when he ſerved his Serenitiy and the Senate, and conſulted with them in their moſt arduous affaires. Then they enjoined him to enquire of him three things concerning the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant publique buſineſſe, which was done that very night at 12. of the clock, the Father cauſing his anſwers to bee written from point to point by his writer, and being ſealed up they were ſent and read that very night in the Senate, who preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the buſineſſe in conformitie to what the Father had conſulted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:98082:113"/>
Now let that ſacred Seſſion, the mirrour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian pietie, and politick prudence, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of two hundred renowned Fathers, and againſt the ſhameleſſe and impudent ſlander which came out of the houſe of one the Ecclefiaſtiques, by the Judg, whether the Father not long before his death had loſt his underſtanding, and his ſpeech or no? And from this calumny ſo malignant and ſhameleſs, let the world give a judgement of many others. The very ſame Saturday he admitted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, as he had done other daies before, and the ſame night after 12 of the clock, the moſt excellent Signor <hi>Giovanni Baſadona</hi> came particularly to viſite him: The Father ſpoke to him, put off his hat, and thanked him for his viſite; and after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture heard one read to him a great while with quiet attention. And when the evening grew dark, thither came <hi>Signor Marco,</hi> with whom hee complied in the ſame manner that he had uſed to do.</p>
            <p>Night being come, and want of ſpirits encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him, he cauſed another reading of the Paſſion written by Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> He ſpake of his own miſery, and of the truſt and confidence which hee had in the bloud of Chriſt. He repeated very often theſe words, <hi>Quem propoſuit Deus mediatorem per fidem in ſanguine ſuo.</hi> In which he ſeemed to receive an extreame conſolation. He repeated (though with much faintneſs) divers places of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> He proteſted, that of his part he had nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God with, but miſeries and finnes, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he deſired to bee drowned in the Abiſſe of the divine mercy, with ſo much ſubmiſſion of one ſide, and yet ſo much cheerfulneſſe of the other ſide, that he drew tears from all that were preſent.</p>
            <p>About the 24. houres he was viſited by Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98082:114"/>that had been with him not long before. And becauſe the famous <hi>Thebaldi</hi> had not viſited him much before that time, the Father making ſome pauſe, becauſe he was unwilling to ſpend out his ſpirits, beckened to <hi>Fulgentie,</hi> to give him ſome account of his ſickneſſe. In which relation, having told him of the accident on Munday, under the terme of a totall defailance, the Father lift up his head, and interrupting ſaid, Defailance of minde? No, I ſay of ſtrength: For as for my minde, it hath alwayes kept its own conſtancy. And the Phyſician being willing to ſay ſomething, did it with thoſe termes of prudence which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſe when they goe from ſick men, and would not leave him without ſome ſparke of hope, whereunto the Father <hi>Fulgentio</hi>) that underſtood the internals of the Father by a long practiſe, how little he regarded living and dying) oppos'd him, and ſaid; Sir, The Father is none of thoſe to whom you ſhall need to ſpeake in a maske, or by ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; And therefore I pray you tell him freely, that he hath endured his ſickneſſe with a great deale of patience, which he ſayd he was a witneſſe of more then any other, whereunto the Father making a figne of aſſent, and ſeeming a little to ſmile, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician told him, that his pulſe gave warning of a flying life; and that it would faile him that night, and within a few houres, to which the Father with gladſome cheere, and a face tending to joy, made anſwer, <hi>Sia lodato Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And thereupon the Phyſician willing to put him in minde of ſome cordialls: The Father interrupting ſayd. Let us now ſorgoe theſe ſoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98082:114"/>and I defire you would reſolve me of two doubts. The firſt, that I am aſſured and have a full perſwafion, that whatſoever you preſent to mee is very good, with ſuch aſſurance I take it into my hand, and when it comes neare my mouth (as if my braines were changed in an iuſtant, it renders it ſelf to me horrid and abhominable. The ſecond (and having ſpoken that word) his breath failed him, and he could not expreſſe the reſt, ſo the Phyſician finding by his veine, that his vitall ſpirit beganne to wander away, appointed that at eight a clock they ſhould give him a Cordiall, and in the meane time ſome rare Moſcate, which he would ſend him from home, at the receiving whereof (there being then paſt ſix houres of night) he ſaid, <hi>Queſta veſta mi pare coſa violenta,</hi> this ſeems to mee to bee a moſt violent thing.</p>
            <p>I will tell you onely one ſlight particular but to ſhew what the conſtancy of his minde was, and his abſolute underſtanding and quickneſs of ſences to the very laſt. The Father had in his chamber di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd things in ſuch order, that he could preſently lay his hand upon any thing that he ſought for, as bookes, writings, inſtruments, and ſuch like, even to the very leaſt and ſmalleſt things. About ſix at night, the laſt of his life, hee would cleanſe his tongue with an inſtrument that he had uſed to that purpoſe a great while, appointing <hi>Fra. Marco</hi> to go fetch it him out of ſuch a place. He went to ſeeke it with a candle in his hand, and return'd telling him it was not there, and hee could not finde it. The Father bad him goe ſeek better; for it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall thing: He return'd and found it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he clenſed his tongue, continuing with thoſe that were preſent with an ineſtimable tranquility,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98082:115"/>and without ſo much as a groane or ſhew of griefe, with memorable words from time to time, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome devout paſſages of Scripture, and very often he would ſay. <hi>Hor ſum audiamo one Dio chiama;</hi> Away, let us be gone whether God calls us. And the ſtanders by ſeeing his voice beganne to faile, and his pulſes beate to an end, entreated him to take a little reſt, at which he laught out; and ſo hee paſt the time in whiſpering to himſelfe, that he could not be well underſtood, except it were ſometimes a word of Scripture, and once he ſaid <hi>Audiaemoa S. Marco che tardi.</hi> Let us go to Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> it begins to belate, which is all that during his fickneſſe was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without connexion and right ſence. In the meane time it ſtrooke eight a clock. He counted it, and calling <hi>Fra Coſſimo</hi> his other ſervant to him ſaid, now tis eight a clocke diſpatch if you will give me that which the Phyſician ordained. But he not able to receive but a ſmall part of it. Afterwards finding himſelfe readie to die, he cald <hi>Fulgentio</hi> to him, and commanded him to leave him with theſe memorable words, which were like to be alwaies engraven in his heart. <hi>Hor ſum non reſtate &amp;c. Now ſtay no longer to behold me in this ſtate it will not he needfull, go to your reſt, and I will goe to god from whence wee came,</hi> And ſo he was willing to be embrac'd and kiſt by him; And though <hi>Fulgentio</hi> knew well what it was to conſirme his minde by the example of ſuch a conſtancy, yet he parted from him; not to leave him but to execute his command, and to obey him in another point which was to goe to the fathers to ſhew him ſo much charitie as to come and aſſiſt him in his paſſage with their prayers.</p>
            <p>So he cal'd the Prior, and the other Friers to come about his bed and make their uſuall prayers
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98082:115"/>and recommendations of that ſoule into the hands of God, who although he could ſpeake no longer, yet with his eyes and ſignes gave aſſurance that he was in a fullneſſe of underſtanding to the very laſt gaſpe. His very laſt words (which were hardly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Fra. Marco</hi> that ſtood over him, yet often repeated) where theſe two <hi>Eſto perpetua.</hi> I doubt not when in that trance he recommended his ſoule to God with ſuch ſervent votes and praiers from his heart, but he remembred to recommend alſo, and to pray for the perpetuity of the moſt ſerene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, to which he had done his ſervice with ſo much faith and charitie. And with thoſe words he loſt his ſpeech, and ſhortly after drew to an end, which was accompanied with two notable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. One was that being unable to move his hands, yet of himſelfe by a force rather of ſpirit (which was all in God) then of his bodie, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them into a croſſe. The other, that fixing his eyes upon the crucifixe which was before him with a naturall deaths head of a Calvary, he held it ſo a while, and then caſting them downeward, and ſhutting them he breathed out his ſoule into the hands of God.</p>
            <p>Thus was the end of this great perſonage, and it pleaſed divine diſpofition that it ſhould be ſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the excellent Senate by a publique writing and under oath, and ſubſcription of all the colledge of the reverend fathers of the <hi>Servi</hi> that were preſent againſt the fabulous falſhoods and impudent lies that were after divulged, that he died howling and crying out with apparitions of black doggs and other things of that kinde, as alſo that in his Cell and chambers there were heard hideous noiſes. Things onely viſible and audible in the far diſtant
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98082:116"/>houſes of the Eccleſiaſtiques, and heard to <hi>Rome,</hi> but never of thoſe that lived in the next chambers nor of any that were preſent.</p>
            <p>Such inventions as theſe were alſo machinated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the memory of Duke <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi> a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Hero,</hi> and before this they were growne to ſuch an impudency to publiſh prodigious things in print which were ſaid to happen in that yeare of the interdict againſt the defenders of the cauſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; this may ſerve for an argument how far the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſuch accidents may be believed, which are written of perſons ſo long after, and ſo far diſtant, that lived in abhomination with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe that theſe examples ſo freſh make me doubt extreamly of the alterations and falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſo many narratives made in time paſt, firſt kept ſecret, and after divulged when the onely fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the factions of the Eccleſiaſtickes had the command of the preſſe, and who without difference have either commended or diſpraiſed ſo many great men, not for matter of truth, but onely becauſe they were either favourable or contrary to their mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane intereſts.</p>
            <p>But the father died as you have heard with a fame to the world (of an incomparable man and with them that knew him) and had to doe with him, of ſo ſingular integrity, and ſanctitie of life as are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeene, &amp; with a commendation which became proverbiall, that if he had beene in the favour of the Court, and ſerved their intereſts he had beene put in the Calender and number of Saints.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> they were very glad to heare of his death with ſuch kinde of diſcourſes, nor could his holineſſe containe himſelfe from ſpeaking of it, as the handy-worke of God to take him out of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98082:116"/>world, as if it had been a miracle for a man to die at the age of 71. But he himſelf was not immortall, for he died himſelfe the ſame yeare about the beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi> He lived in the world ſeaventle one years, which was a decrepit age if you conſider his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, or his conſummate wiſdome and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue, and his either deſires or hopes to live being but too ſhort a time if you conſider the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the publique received from him, or the common deſire that was afterward of him becauſe it concerned the moſt excellent republique, that his ſervice ſhould have beene as durable as it was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. A paterne of ſo rare vertues was worthie of a longer old age, or rather of a perpetuall youth, if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie could have borne it in this life. But to him for his owne ſake, death which could not be unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected was not untimly yet at leaſt to us and for our ſakes twas bitter, and if he lived long enogh for himſelfe, yet lived he too little for the publique, for which he onely lived. Vpon this occaſion his Cell was ſeene and viſited by very many who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that religious povertie without any ornament were very well ſatisfied, and the principall Senators ſaid <hi>it was a paradice where a good Angell dwelt.</hi> And the moſt excellent <hi>Leonardo Moro</hi> who is one of the perfections of all vertues and particularly of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and chriſtian piety could not containe himſelfe from ſaying. <hi>Is this the father whom the prelates of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly church have ſo much defamed, Is he then a wicked man, and are they the imitators of Chriſtand his Apoſtles?</hi> His funerals were conſpicuous both for the publick munificence, and for a numerous concourſe of great perſons of every fort but for coſt It exceeded not his private condition ſave onely in a publique griefe. And it was obſerved that his face was well colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98082:117"/>and ſmiling, and as they ſaid more venerable &amp; beautifull when he was dead then when he lived. An after nine monthes that the coffin was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe wherein he was laid, they found him both entire, and with his face freſh coloured.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Fulgentio</hi> was the firſt that went about to honour his memory by ſome workes, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent would not ſuffer him, who reſolved to make it a publique act. But the moſt excellent ſenate deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the difference by a publique decree that at the publique charge there ſhould be made a memoriall and inſcription, which may be ſo much the more illuſtrious and durable becauſe as yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done in it. And likewiſe she fame and infamie of thoſe is like to be eternall who keepe an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred againſt the dead with a malignitie of finding blemiſhes in ſo precious a jemme, or clouds in ſo reſplendent a jewell, which in ſuch an excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent creature either never were or elſe ſo little that they were inviſible, except it were to the eyes of of conſummate malignitie. And according to the wiſe man. The raſh imprudence of thoſe men ſhall be had in deriſion who being raiſed into fortune preſume to the patrons even of fame and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it that it ſhould not paſſe to poſteritie.</p>
            <p>And as for the glorie of this great <hi>Hero's</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a creature, (as it happens to ſome captaines of great valour) his tryumphe encreaſt more being denied then granted. As the impediment was knowne to ariſe from theſe wicked tyrants <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> and others ſo it may happen to father <hi>Paul.</hi> And if a ſneild ſhould he made for him with his effigies the ſame event would befall it as was ſaid of the images of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> that in a funerall pompe they were more conſpicuous and prefulgent,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98082:117"/>becauſe by the violence of the Tyranny they were not ſeene among the others. And, if there remaine any ſence of theſe humane conſolations, to thoſe that are in God. That great ſoule of father <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall receive content, that the perverſitie of others hath favoured his intentions, which were deſpiſing of all other conſolations of the living Father <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall live eternally in God who is the onely good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe deſireable, but yet he ſhall live in the memorie of men by his heroique vertues, againſt which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, neither time which conſumes marbles and mettalle ſhall prevaile, much leſſe that fooliſh poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique error of them that believe, that the fame of men can live in a ſtone, which is ſubject to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the moſt wretched ſort of people.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the time that's paſt, is the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer of that which is to come. I muſt not forget, that among others that were preſent at that pious exemplarie and happie death of the good father, there was one ſent thither who went in obedience to ſome body that foreſaw more then others, <hi>Maeſtro A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſtino Meſani</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi>) ſurnamed the Poet, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo tied up by the truth upon his oath, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſubſcribed to that narrative above mentioned (which was preſented to the moſt excellent Senate) (this man favoured &amp; defended by Father <hi>Paul</hi> upon many occaſions, who was the rather moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate him for his inconſiſtent braine) This man being brought in by a kinſman of his that was ſaid to ſerve as a ſpy, or (as I have it more probable) by his own raſhneſs &amp; fooliſh hopes, into the houſeof the Signor <hi>Nuntie</hi> was alſo ſaid to have made relations there which where only worthy of himſelfe. He that never knew obligation to tel truth, nor to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within terms of modeſtie. But that he should be
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98082:118"/>examined againe and his narration regiſtred, it was not very like, although the Frier himſelf brag'd of it.</p>
            <p>True it is that from thence hee returned to his Convent, being full of conceipts, which by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fooliſhneſſe (becauſe hee was a foole, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly knowne to be ſo, but yet of an ill tongue and very miſchievous) not being able to conceale, or rather ſaying publiquely, that he ſhould ſhortly bee above either a Generall or a Provinciall. But this laſted but awhile, becauſe thoſe that were about the Nuntio underſtood too well the carriage of ſuch people, and what ſervice could bee expected from ſuch as he was. It may bee alſo that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of his cuſtomes and qualities to be ſuch, as cannot with honeſty bee related. But let it ſerve to caſt a veile over him, by ſaying that he is <hi>Muliebriter infamis, &amp; vita proboſus,</hi> and with Superiours hee had been priviledged, onely by his folly. That in more than fifteen yeares he had neither made confeſſion, nor recited office, although hee had ſometimes cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Maſſe, and when the Superiours went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reforme it in him, hee preſently turn'd Apoſtata, as he had done at other times before.</p>
            <p>Let not this note bee thought impertinent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this mans relations another time may appeare under the name of a Theologiſt, or Maſter of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as others in the like kinde with, and without names, have cauſed to be committed from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Vicar Generall Apoſtolicall <hi>(Maeſtro Filippo Ferrari de Alexandria)</hi> to make certaine heynous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifitions againſt others. But they have had the ordinary event of thoſe that move informations upon ſuch ſubjects, and the very letters themſelves of the Generall have been ſeen by me to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where it hath appeared that all that had been written and affirmed were falſe.</p>
